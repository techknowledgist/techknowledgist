<h1>Technology Ontology Creation Manual</h1>

<p class="author">
Version 1, September 2014
</p>

<p>Documentation is available on the following:</p>

<ul class="spacy">

<li><a href="installation.html">Installation</a>

<li><a href="document-processing.html">Document processing and feature extraction</a>

<li><a href="classifier.html">Technology classifier</a>

<li><a href="maturity.html">Maturity scores</a>

<li><a href="inventions.html">Invention key terms</a>

<li><a href="roles.html">Technology roles</a>

</ul>

<p>Technology scores and maturity scores are typically generated on a subset of
the available data, and often created for a set of domains (computers, molecular
biology, mechanical engineering, and so on). In addition, scores are usually
created for each year. What this amounts to is that we usually create a corpus
of patents for a given year and a given domain and then process this corpus as a
unit. The workflow outlined in the sections above follows that assumption.</p>
