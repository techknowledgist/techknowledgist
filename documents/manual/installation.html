<h1>Ontology Creation - Installation</h1>


<p class="navigation">
<a href="index.html">index</a> > <a href="installation.html">installation</a>
</p>


<p>Requirements for running the code:</p>

<ol>
<li>Python 2.6 or 2.7
<li>Java 1.6
<li>SQLite 3.3.6 or higher (probably any major version of 3 or higher)
<li>xsltproc and xmllint
<li>Git 1.8 (needed only for getting the code, slightly older versions most likely will also work)
</ol>

<p>The code has been tested on RHEL 6 and  Mac OS 10.6.</p>


<p>Installation is a matter of (1) getting the git repository and installing the
sub modules, (2) installing third party software (Stanford tools and Mallet
classifier), and (3) dowloading the classifier models.</p>

<ol>


<li><p>The code is available at the git repository at</p>

<pre class="example">
http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~marc/git/fuse/patent-classifier.git
</pre>

<p>When you are reading this document you probably already have the code, but if not, obtain it by

<pre class="example">
$ git clone http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~marc/git/fuse/patent-classifier.git
</pre>

<p>After getting the clone, you need to initialize and update the submodules
used by the repository:</p>

<pre class="example">
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update 
</pre>


<li>Stanford Tools.


<li>The code uses version 2.0.7 of the Mallet toolkit<sup>1</sup>, available
at <a href="http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/"
target="_blank">http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/</a>. Other versions will most likely
work as well, but were not tested. You can get the version we use at

<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~marc/fuse/downloads/tools/"
target="_blank">http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~marc/fuse/downloads/tools/</a>
</blockquote>

<li>There are small classifer models (for technology classifier and key term
extraction) bundled in with the code, which is sufficient when you just try to
see if the code runs, but eventually you will want to get a better
model. Technology classifier models are available at:

<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~marc/fuse/downloads/models/"
target="_blank">http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~marc/fuse/downloads/models/</a>
</blockquote>

<p>There is currently only one model available. You can easily create your own
models, as described in the manual section on the technology classifier.

Getting tries

We are assuming that (i) you have the misc repository in Dropbox/code/misc, (ii) the
patent classifier code is in ~/Desktop/FUSE/code/patent-classifier/utils, and (iii) the
current commit is f296e3e0acea70176978055ae8a3919987ee944b.

% cd ~/Dropbox/code/misc
% ./export.sh tries ~/Desktop/FUSE/code/patent-classifier/utils
% cd ~/Desktop/FUSE/code/patent-classifier/utils
% tar xfvp tries.f296e3e0acea70176978055ae8a3919987ee944b.tar
