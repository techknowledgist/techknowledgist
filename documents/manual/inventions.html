<h1>Ontology Creation - Invention Key Terms</h1>

<p class="abstract">
Invention key terms are terms that fill some function relative to the invention
described in the patent (US or CN). There are two versions of this
functionality: one that runs on the result of document processing of a corpus
and one that builds key terms from scratch using a list of files. The latter is
much faster and is the one that is decribed here. It uses a slightly simplified
document processing pipeline, applies the invention key terms model and then
reorganizes the results in seversal ways.

<a name="input"></a>
<h2>Input Description</h2>

<p>The input is a list with file path specifications, an example is printed
below.</p>

<pre class="example">
workspace/data/sample-010/US6673330B1
workspace/data/sample-010/US6674661B1
workspace/data/sample-010/US6675175B2
workspace/data/sample-010/US6676627B1.txt   workspace/data/sample-010/US6676627B1.fact
workspace/data/sample-010/US6678572B1.txt   workspace/data/sample-010/US6678572B1.fact
</pre>

<p>This is a fragement of the example file list bundled with the code, which can
be found at <code>ontology/runtime/workspace/data/list-010.txt</code>. A line
includes either just a file name with extension or two tab-separated file paths,
one for the text file and one for the fact file. In the former case the text
file and fact file are assumed to be in the same directory.</p>

<a name="howto"></a>
<h2>Generating Keyterms</h2>

<p>The toplevel code is in <code>ontology/runtime</code>. To run the code on a
  list of files, change into that directory and do the following:</p>

<pre class="example">
$ python keyterms.py --filelist workspace/data/list-010.txt
</pre>

<p>With this invocation, results are written to a time stamped directory
  in <code>workspace/results</code>. There are a couple of other options, all
  optional:</p>

<pre class="example">
--language en|cn
--run-id STRING
--mallet-dir PATH
--segmenter-dir PATH
--tagger-dir PATH
--verbose
--condense-results
</pre>

<p>With <code>--language</code> the language of the input can be specified, the
default is to use 'en'.</p>

<p>The <code>--run-id</code> option defines an identifier for the current
run. The default is to use the current timestamp. The run-id determines where
the temporary files and results file are written to. For example, with a run-id
of 'run-018', temporary files are written to workspace/tmp/run-018 and result
files are written to workspace/results/run-018.</p>

<p>The options <code>--mallet-dir</code>, <code>--segmenter-dir</code>
and <code>--tagger-dir</code> can be used to overrule the default directories
for the mallet classifier and the stanford segmenter and tagger. There are
actually two ways of doing this. One is to edit the <code>config.py</code> file
in <code>ontology/runtime</code>this directory. The other is to use these
options. If both are used, the command line options overrule the values in
config.py. See config.py for more information. In short, one should use a path
like "/tools/stanford/stanford-postagger-full-2012-07-09" or
"/tools/mallet/mallet-2.0.7/bin".

<p>With <code>--verbose</code> progress messages will be printed to the
terminal. Information printed includes: location of classifier and tagger, file
that is being pre-processed (tagging and chunking), and commands executed during
classification.

<p>With <code>--condense-results</code>, not all result files will be present in
the results directory. Only the two tab files (iclassify.MaxEnt.label.merged.tab
and iclassify.MaxEnt.label.relations.tab) and the info file will be written.</p>


<a name="output"></a>
<h2>Output Description</h2>

<p>Results are printed to a set of files in the results directory. All files
have the prefix 'iclassify'. The table below has a short description of the
output files. Note that in <code>--condense-results</code> only the two tab 
files and the info file will be available.</p>

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0 border=1>
<tr>
  <td>iclassify.info 
  <td>some minimal info about the completed run
<tr>
  <td>iclassify.mallet
  <td>input file for the mallet classifier
<tr>
  <td>iclassify.MaxEnt.out
  <td>output file of the cassifier
<tr>
  <td>iclassify.MaxEnt.stderr
  <td>error messages from the classifier
<tr>
  <td>iclassify.MaxEnt.label
  <td>condensed version of classifier output
<tr>
  <td>iclassify.MaxEnt.label.cat
  <td>minimal keyterm information
<tr>
  <td>iclassify.MaxEnt.label.merged
  <td>keyterms per document
<tr>
  <td>iclassify.MaxEnt.label.merged.tab
  <td>tabbed version of the previous
<tr>
  <td>iclassify.MaxEnt.label.relations.tab
  <td>relations between terms
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>Most usable for the inventions may
be <code>iclassify.MaxEnt.label.merged.tab</code>, which has four columns:</p>

</pre>

<p>The first column is the patent id and it is followed by the basename of the
file processed. The third column has the type of the term: i for invention, t
for invention type, ct for contextual term, and ca for component/attribute. The
last column has the term.</p>

<p>The file iclassify.MaxEnt.label.relations.tab contains relations between
terms. Three types of relations are extracted:

<pre class="example">
i-ca   relation between invention and a component/attribute
i-ct   relation between an invention and a contextual term
ca-ca  two terms that are both components/attributes of the same invention
</pre>

<p>The file itself has three columns, the relation type, the first term and the
second term.</p>

<p>See the documentation string in <code>keyterms.py</code> for more
information on the output.</p>
