Installation Instructions
----------------------------------------------------------------

Marc Verhagen, May 2013


Instructions are for Linux/Unix and Mac OSX. 

In the first case, there is a configuration assumption that you are running your
code from inside /home/j, in the second case, the assumption is that code is
inside /Users. If neither is the case, some editing of the configurations in
ontology/creation/config.py will be needed.



1. Get the Git repository

On the cs machines: 

  $ git clone /home/j/marc/git/fuse/patent-classifier

Elsewhere (still assumes you have a CS account):

  $ git clone ssh://USERNAME@chalciope.cs.brandeis.edu/home/j/marc/git/fuse/patent-classifier

In both cases, a directory named patent-classifier will be created in your
working directory.


2. Initialize submodules

The patent classifier relies on a submodule that needs to be initialize and
updated separately:

  $ cd patent-classifier
  $ git submodule init
  $ git submodule update


3. Get the tries code

This is a utility that is not yet turned into a submodule, so there is a
slightly convoluted way of installing it.

On a department machine:

  $ cp -r /home/j/corpuswork/fuse/code/patent-classifier/utils/tries utils

Elsewhere (assumes you have a CS account):

  $ scp -r USERNAME@chalciope.cs.brandeis.edu:/home/j/corpuswork/fuse/code/patent-classifier/utils/tries utils


4. Install Mallet and the Stanford tools.

If you run the code on a CS machine from inside the /home/j directory, then
installation of Mallet and Stanford tools is not needed.

On OSX, first get the sources:

  $ scp USERNAME@chalciope.cs.brandeis.edu:/home/j/corpuswork/fuse/code/patent-classifier/tools/mallet.tar .

  $ scp USERNAME@chalciope.cs.brandeis.edu:/home/j/corpuswork/fuse/code/patent-classifier/tools/stanford/stanford-postagger-full-2012-07-09.tar .

  $ scp USERNAME@chalciope.cs.brandeis.edu:/home/j/corpuswork/fuse/code/patent-classifier/tools/stanford/stanford-segmenter-2012-07-09.tar .

The second and third are large and may take a while. These files need to be
unpacked in a directory named /Applications/ADDED/nlp and you need to end up
with the following directories:

  /Applications/ADDED/nlp/mallet/mallet-2.0.7/
  /Applications/ADDED/nlp/stanford/stanford-postagger-full-2012-07-09/
  /Applications/ADDED/nlp/stanford/stanford-segmenter-2012-07-09/


5. Get the sample patents.

On the CS machines you don't need to get them, they live at

  /home/j/corpuswork/fuse/fuse-patents/500-patents

Elsewhere, scp the archive:

  $ scp USERNAME@chalciope.cs.brandeis.edu:/home/j/corpuswork/fuse/fuse-patents/patents.tar.gz .

Then unpack it and put it anywhere.


6. Read the very limited documentation

Files to look at

  documents/installation.txt (this file)
  documents/ontology-creation/batch-processing.html
  ontology/creation/step?_*.py


7. Run the processing scripts in ontology/creation

These all start with the prefix 'step'.

Note that the steps above will steer you towards using the -s option in
step1_initialzie.py, which is fine but it will result on long local path names
in the data directory. Take a peek at create-file-list.py in
ontology/creation/data/patents/ for a way to generate a file list that can be
used with the -f option.
