=== To get a running system

Most work is already done by virtue of having cloned the patent-classifier repository.

But you need to copy two utilities that are not in the repository (I am not quite
confortable yet using git submodules or git subtree merging).

1. Getting tries

We are assuming that (i) you have the misc repository in Dropbox/code/misc, (ii) the
patent classifier code is in ~/Desktop/FUSE/code/patent-classifier/utils, and (iii) the
current commit is f296e3e0acea70176978055ae8a3919987ee944b.

% cd ~/Dropbox/code/misc
% ./export.sh tries ~/Desktop/FUSE/code/patent-classifier/utils
% cd ~/Desktop/FUSE/code/patent-classifier/utils
% tar xfvp tries.f296e3e0acea70176978055ae8a3919987ee944b.tar


2. Getting the document structure parser

The utils/import-docstructure.sh does not work on OSX 10.4 if you used the binary
installer in http://metastatic.org/source/git-osx.html. This is because that git version
is 1.5.4.3 and the import script relies on a more recent version of git. In that case,
just copy the docustruture code to the utils directory.
