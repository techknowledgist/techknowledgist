<h2>Notes on the classification processing steps</h2>


<h3>Annotation</h2>


<h3>Trainer -- input arguments and invocation</h3>

<p>Input to the training (model building) phase is the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>a target directory and a language</li>
<li>a file with annotations, with optionally a number of lines to take</li>
<li>a file list that has all the files that the model is to be trained on</li>
<li>a configuration file with the pipeline configuration</li>
<li>a version identifier</li>
<li>a cross-validation setting (the xval variable)</li>
</ol>

<p>The training stages creates a bunch of files in the t1_train directory. Let's say I use
the following invocation:</p>

<p class="pre move-up">
% python step4_classify.py 
     --utrain -t data/patents -l en 
     --config pipeline-default.txt --filelist training-files-v1.txt
     --annotation-file ../annotation/en/phr_occ.lab --annotation-count 2000
     --version standard --xval 0
</p>

<p>(many of these options have defaults, but I spelled them all out)</p>


<h3>Trainer -- files created</h3>

<p>The --train processing step creates the following files in data/t1_train:</p>


<p><u>utrain-standard-info-general.txt</u></p>

<p class="indent">This file contains all setting needed to replicate creating the
model. Note that "standard" the value of the --version option and that it serves as an
identifier. It can be any string and it is up to the user to make it suffieciently
descriptive to uniquely identify the character of the trained model. This same identifier
should be used for the testing phase. For the above command, the contents of the file are
as follows:</p>

<p class="pre move-up">
   version           standard
   xval              0
   file_list         training-files-v1.txt
   annotation_file   ../annotation/en/phr_occ.lab
   annotation_count  2000
   config_file       pipeline-default.txt
   git commit        v0.2-10-g9cbc97c
</p>


<p><u>utrain-standard-info-filelist.txt</u></p>

<p class="indent">This contains a local copy of the file list with all training files.</p>


<p><u>utrain-standard-info-config.txt</u></p>

<p class="indent">This contains a local copy of the pipeline configuration. Notice that
this is the file used to select a dataset.</p>


<p><u>utrain-standard-info-annotations.txt</u></p>

<p class="indent">Contains a local copy of the annotations file. Only takes the first n
lines, where n is the value of the --annotation-count option.</p>


<p><u>utrain-standard-features-doc_feats.txt</u><br/>
   <u>utrain-standard-features-phr_feats.txt</u>
</p>

<p class="indent">Created from the dataset selected with the config file, using just those
files in the file list. These two perform the same function as the files created with the
old --summary setting, gathering all data and putting them in a single file (the
difference is that file naming is now more flexible and that the file is added to the
train directory rather than the old ws directory). These files are not used when building
a model, but could be used downstream. If downstream processing uses the same approach as
the model builder, then these files do not need to be created unless we want t keep them
for housekeeping reasons.</p>


<p><u>utrain-standard-mallet</u><br/>
   <u>utrain-standard-MaxEnt.model</u><br/>
   <u>utrain-standard-MaxEnt.out</u><br/>
   <u>utrain-standard-MaxEnt.stderr</u>
</p>

<p class="indent">These are the same as before.</p>


<h3>Classifying -- input arguments and invocation</h3>

<p>Input to the classification phase is the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>a target directory and a language</li>
<li>a file list that has all the files that the classifier needs to run on</li>
<li>a configuration file with the pipeline configuration</li>
<li>a version identifier</li>
<li>a version identifier for the trained model to be used</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is an example invocation:</p>

<p class="pre move-up">
python step4_classify.py
    --classify -t data/patents -l en
    --config pipeline-default.txt --filelist testing-files-v1.txt
    --model standard --version standard.batch1
</p>

<p>The version id of the classification run is defined by the user and identifies a single
run on a set of files. It is possible to have two runs, with different version ids, that
are equal with respect to target directory, language, configuration and model
identifier. You would do this when running the classifier on the first 5000 files, then on
the second 5000. It is advisable to have this reflected in the version id or in the
name of the file list, or in both. For example:

<p class="pre move-up">
--version standard.batch1 --filelist files-00000-05000.txt
--version standard.batch2 --filelist files-05000-10000.txt
</p>

<p>The system does not enforce that the configuration file used for classifying is the
same as the configuration file used by the model specified in the --model option. This is
as it should be because we may want to explore whether models built with a certain
configuration performs well when the configuration changes.</p>



<h3>Testing -- input arguments and invocation</h3>

<p>Input to the classification phase is the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>a target directory and a language (-t and -l options)</li>
<li>a version identifier of the classification run (--results option)</li>
<li>a file with labeled instances (--gold-standard option)
</ol>

<p>Here is an example invocation:</p>

<p class="pre move-up">
python step4_classify.py
    --test -t data/patents -l en
    --results standard.batch1 --gold-standard
</p>

<p>The main idea here is that all this phase does is take the results from a
classification run and compare it to a gold standard. It will take the gold standard
annotations ...</p>

<p>NO, STOP IT RIGHT THERE!</p>

<p>This may cause problems because it utterly decouples the annotation from the files the
unlabeled instances were taken from. My goal was to make this lightweight, but it is
better to having --test also do all that --classify does. There still will not be strict
coupling, but at least we would define a filelist which could be input to both annotation
and testing.</p>
