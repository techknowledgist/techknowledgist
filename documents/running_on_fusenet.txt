Running English pipeline using batch.py on 5000 documents
=========================================================

--init

Note that the step where ALL_FILES.txt is created has to be done by hand.


--populate

Trivial copy of files


--xml2txt

Errors on 6 files:
   [--xml2txt] 1231 creating /shared/home/marc/batch/en/txt/2005/US20050177225A1.xml

In all cases, the output was a file with just one line containing the word 'END'

Processing time: less than 20 minutes, 0.25s/document


--txt2tag

Ran this frist in batches of 500, but did last 2500 in one batch.

Processing time on first batch of 500: less than 10 minutes, 1s/document

processing time on batch of 2500: just over 40 minutes, 1s/document

No errors while tagging. The files that caused errors in the previous step now have just
one line with 'END_NN'.


--intermezzo

At this point (after tagging the first 5000 documents) we have a directory with 3.6G of
data. Removing the intermediate files in ds_* (created by the document parser) reduces
this number to 1.4G

More specifically, disk usage for xmt, txt and tag directories:

	482016  xml
	241668  txt
	352872  tag


Protected all tagged files from accidental removal:

	chmod 555 tag
	chmod 555 tag/*
	chmod 444 tag/*/*


--tag2chk

Note: check what happens with the END_NN files.



Running German pipeline using batch.py on 5000 documents
========================================================


--xml2txt

In many cases there is no German text in the file and all we get is a file with content
like

   FH_DATE:
   19800508
   END

After about three minutes the system breaks on 

   [--xml2txt] 2380 creating /shared/home/marc/batch/de/txt/2007/DE102006022365B3.xml

The reason is that there is a line in the fact file with an unescaped double quote:

   SECTION ID=73 PARENT_ID=4 TYPE="OTHER" 
   TITLE="Aktionsanweisung AA1: %Gâ%@Limit forwarding to eguidistant nodes":" 
   START=22197 END=23364

Need to solve this properly, but for now just added code to batch.py to catch this
error (and other errors in this stage).


--txt2tag

Processing time for first batch of 500: about 7 minutes, 0.84s/doc.

Processing time for batch of 4000: 57 minutes, 0.86s/doc.

A bit faster than for English, but that is mostly due to the size of the patents. In fact,
I would have expected it to be even faster.

No errors noticed. The file that had an error in the stepabove is simply an empty file
after this step.

Sizes of directories:

	223272  xml
	109340  txt
	163168  tag

Like with English, the tagged files were frozen.
