This directory is intended to contain the following:

- patent corpora as generated by the code in patent-classifier/ontology/creation

- file lists with slices of the patent data

- a couple of utility scripts to create and/or amend file lists

Only the scripts and this file are in the git repository, the lists and corpora
are not under version control (one could make a case toput the lists under
version control though).


One useful command is the following perl one-liner which randomly shuffles a
file:

$ cat myfile | perl -MList::Util=shuffle -e 'print shuffle(<STDIN>);'
