	- The virtual runway projection is positioned in the vision field according to <np> data </np>
	  generated by communication between a computer with and the airport instrument landing system -LRB-
	  ILS -RRB- which employs a VHF radio beam .
	- With these <np> data </np> , the computer is able to generate an optical image -LRB- photon -RRB- to
	  be projected and combined with the real scene -LRB- photon -RRB- that passes through the combiner
	  and thereby enhancing certain features of the real scene ; for example runway boundaries .
	- HUDs can align the <np> data </np> generated image that is indexed to the slow moving airplane axis
	  which moves slowly in relation to a runway .
	- For this reason , HMDs generally display <np> data </np> that does not change with the pilots head
	  movements such as altitude and airspeed .
	- The image processing system comprises a data processor and a graphic processor generating an image
	  to be displayed by the display means based on <np> data </np> generated by the data processor .

	  data </np> to image processing unit 14 .
	- System 100 comprises a video input device , such as a camera 102 , which accepts optical image
	  information and generates a corresponding digital video in the form of IEEE 1394 -LRB- FireWire
	  -RRB- <np> data </np> .
	- This chipset accepts the IEEE 1394 <np> data </np> from camera 102 and generates command and data in
	  a Zoom Video bus 106 and a Peripheral Component Interconnect -LRB- PCI -RRB- bus 108 .
	- Chipset 104 receives the IEEE 1394 serial data stream -LRB- at up to 400 Mbits\/second -RRB- and

	- -LRB- 0002 -RRB- This invention relates to storage of data to magnetic tape , and , more
	  particularly , to storage of synchronized data , <np> data </np> which is to be physically written
	  to tape before a command complete response can be made , so that the entity sending the data is able
	  to erase its data , knowing that a copy physically exists on magnetic tape .

	  before a command complete response can be made , so that the entity sending the data is able to
	  erase its <np> data </np> , knowing that a copy physically exists on magnetic tape .
	- <np> Data </np> stored in this manner has an aspect of permanence which allows copies of the data
	  stored in memory or disk at a host system to be erased , knowing that a copy exists on magnetic tape
	  .
	- Hence , <np> data </np> is typically transferred through an intermediate staging buffer , such as a
	  hard disk , to the tape drive , and there is also a desire to release and overwrite the staging
	  buffer as soon as possible .
	- -LRB- 0004 -RRB- Thus , it is often desirable to `` synchronize '' the <np> data </np> .
	- -LRB- 0005 -RRB- `` Synchronized <np> data </np> '' is defined as data or other information which is
	  subject to a `` synchronizing event '' or similar command requiring the tape drive to not return ``
	  Command Complete '' to a write type of command , or an indication that the command has been or will
	  be successfully executed , until it has actually committed the data to media , specifically , the
	  magnetic tape .
	- -LRB- 0005 -RRB- `` Synchronized data '' is defined as data or other information which is subject to
	  a `` synchronizing event '' or similar command requiring the tape drive to not return `` Command
	  Complete '' to a write type of command , or an indication that the command has been or will be
	  successfully executed , until it has actually committed the <np> data </np> to media , specifically
	  , the magnetic tape .
	- As the result , if power is lost , the <np> data </np> can be recovered from the tape , whereas it
	  may not be recoverable from a volatile DRAM storage of the tape drive buffer .
	- This means that the drive is not to respond immediately , but instead is to respond when the command
	  has completed , meaning that any <np> data </np> sent as part of the command is written out to tape
	  .
	- A specialized case of a Write Filemark command is where the number of Filemarks field is also set to
	  `` 0 '' , meaning that the Write Filemark command has no <np> data </np> of its own , and all data
	  which precedes the command must be written to tape before a command complete is sent .
	- A specialized case of a Write Filemark command is where the number of Filemarks field is also set to
	  `` 0 '' , meaning that the Write Filemark command has no data of its own , and all <np> data </np>
	  which precedes the command must be written to tape before a command complete is sent .
	- `` Command Complete '' is not returned for any write command until the <np> data </np> is
	  successfully written on media .
	- -LRB- 0009 -RRB- A difficulty with respect to magnetic tape is that the <np> data </np> is recorded
	  sequentially without long gaps between data sets , whereas synchronized transactions are stored in
	  separate bursts for each synchronizing event , with a noticeable time period before writing the next
	  transaction .
	- -LRB- 0010 -RRB- Briefly , the cross referenced application , as pointed out by the abstract ,
	  writes synchronized <np> data </np> to magnetic tape while reducing the number of backhitches .
	- -LRB- 0011 -RRB- Should an error occur during the process , such as a power off or permanent write
	  error , a read recovery process is needed to recover the synchronized <np> data </np> .
	- -LRB- 0014 -RRB- In one embodiment , the magnetic tape drive recording system comprises at least one
	  recording channel receiving data to be written to the magnetic tape , the <np> data </np> in the
	  form of transactions , the recording channel -LRB- s -RRB- for operating the read\/write head -LRB-
	  s -RRB- for writing transactions to the magnetic tape ; and a controller operating the motor -LRB- s
	  -RRB- , and the recording channel -LRB- s -RRB- .
	- -LRB- 0015 -RRB- The controller detects a pattern of synchronizing events for writing the
	  transactions to the magnetic tape as synchronized transactions ; writes the synchronized
	  transactions to the magnetic tape as written synchronized transactions , in the form of data sets ,
	  each data set having a data set information table ; and in the event one of the written synchronized
	  transactions , or the end of a transaction , partially fills a data set , rewrites the partially
	  filled <np> data </np> set in a succeeding data set , and appends a subsequent synchronized
	  transaction in the succeeding data set as an appended synchronized transaction ; and establishes a
	  moving access point for the succeeding data set in the data set information table of the succeeding
	  data set , the moving access point identifying the appended synchronized transaction , thereby
	  skipping the rewritten synchronized transaction .
	- 12 is a diagrammatic illustration of a data set for synchronized <np> data </np> ;
	- Tape drives often employ a `` read after write '' process to insure that the <np> data </np> is
	  written correctly to provide an aspect of permanence .
	- Hence , <np> data </np> is typically transferred through an intermediate staging buffer , such as a
	  hard disk , to the tape drive , and there is also a desire to release and overwrite the staging
	  buffer as soon as possible .
	- -LRB- 0044 -RRB- In order to release the staging buffer , it is necessary to have an assurance that
	  the <np> data </np> has actually been recorded on the magnetic tape 14 , and is not just in a
	  volatile DRAM storage , such as buffer 30 , and may be lost if power to the buffer or to the drive
	  is lost .
	- Thus , it is often desirable to `` synchronize '' the <np> data </np> , requiring the tape drive to
	  not return `` Command Complete '' to a write type of command , or an indication that the command has
	  been or will be successfully executed , until it has actually committed the data to media ,
	  specifically , the magnetic tape 14 .
	- Thus , it is often desirable to `` synchronize '' the data , requiring the tape drive to not return
	  `` Command Complete '' to a write type of command , or an indication that the command has been or
	  will be successfully executed , until it has actually committed the <np> data </np> to media ,
	  specifically , the magnetic tape 14 .
	- Once the <np> data </np> has been written to the magnetic tape , if power is lost , the data can be
	  recovered from the tape , whereas it may not be recoverable from a volatile DRAM storage of the tape
	  drive buffer .
	- Once the data has been written to the magnetic tape , if power is lost , the <np> data </np> can be
	  recovered from the tape , whereas it may not be recoverable from a volatile DRAM storage of the tape
	  drive buffer .
	- This means that the drive is not to respond immediately , but instead is to respond when the command
	  has completed , meaning that any <np> data </np> sent as part of the command is written out to tape
	  .
	- A specialized case of a Write Filemark command is where the number of Filemarks field is also set to
	  `` 0 '' , meaning that the Write Filemark command has no <np> data </np> of its own , and the only
	  meaning of the command is that all data which precedes the command must be written to tape before a
	  command complete is sent .

	  `` 0 '' , meaning that the Write Filemark command has no data of its own , and the only meaning of
	  the command is that all <np> data </np> which precedes the command must be written to tape before a
	  command complete is sent .
	- 2 , <np> data </np> is typically recorded on magnetic tape sequentially with only short gaps between
	  data sets , for example between data sets 31 and 32 , 32 and 33 , etc. .
	- <np> Data </np> typically comprises a string of records arranged in data sets , each with a DSS ,
	  which are written with nominal spacing .
	- -LRB- 0047 -RRB- However , if the <np> data </np> is synchronized , it must be immediately written
	  to tape from the buffer , and only after the synchronized transaction has been written to tape is
	  the transaction erased from the buffer and overwritten , such that it can not be the subject of a
	  continuous data flow .
	- Thus , the prior art process requires that the tape drive 10 backhitch -LRB- shown by arrow 71 -RRB-
	  after writing data set 31 -LRB- to synchronize transaction record 50 -RRB- , to be positioned to
	  write <np> data </np> set 32 with a minimum amount of DSS pattern in between ; to backhitch 72 after
	  writing data set 32 to synchronize transaction record 51 , and write data set 33 ; etc. .
	- Thus , the prior art process requires that the tape drive 10 backhitch -LRB- shown by arrow 71 -RRB-
	  after writing data set 31 -LRB- to synchronize transaction record 50 -RRB- , to be positioned to
	  write data set 32 with a minimum amount of DSS pattern in between ; to backhitch 72 after writing
	  data set 32 to synchronize transaction record 51 , and write <np> data </np> set 33 ; etc. .
	- The process continues until all of the synchronized <np> data </np> has been written .
	- 1 and 3 illustrate embodiments of the present invention for reducing the number of backhitches for
	  the synchronized <np> data </np> .
	- 3 , stored in the buffer 30 ; writes the detected synchronized transaction record 50 , with EM 60 ,
	  from the buffer to the magnetic tape as <np> data </np> set 80 ; continuing the gap with or without
	  separator signals 90 until a subsequently received synchronized transaction 51 -LRB- data set 81
	  -RRB- is written to the magnetic tape following the separator signals , and this may leave an
	  elongated gap which comprises an unrecorded gap and\/or written separator signals 90 -LRB- e.g. ,
	  DSS -RRB- to the magnetic tape following the written synchronized transaction record 50 -LRB- data
	  set 80 -RRB- ; and repeats the detection of a synchronized received transaction -LRB- e.g. , record
	  51 -RRB- , writing the detected synchronized transaction -LRB- as data set 81 -RRB- , and writing
	  the gap of separator signals -LRB- e.g. , separator signals 91 -RRB- , etc. , for each succeeding
	  detected synchronized received transaction , such that the tape is moved longitudinally during the
	  repeated writing without stopping .
	- 3 , stored in the buffer 30 ; writes the detected synchronized transaction record 50 , with EM 60 ,
	  from the buffer to the magnetic tape as data set 80 ; continuing the gap with or without separator
	  signals 90 until a subsequently received synchronized transaction 51 -LRB- data set 81 -RRB- is
	  written to the magnetic tape following the separator signals , and this may leave an elongated gap
	  which comprises an unrecorded gap and\/or written separator signals 90 -LRB- e.g. , DSS -RRB- to the
	  magnetic tape following the written synchronized transaction record 50 -LRB- <np> data </np> set 80
	  -RRB- ; and repeats the detection of a synchronized received transaction -LRB- e.g. , record 51
	  -RRB- , writing the detected synchronized transaction -LRB- as data set 81 -RRB- , and writing the
	  gap of separator signals -LRB- e.g. , separator signals 91 -RRB- , etc. , for each succeeding
	  detected synchronized received transaction , such that the tape is moved longitudinally during the
	  repeated writing without stopping .
	- 3 , stored in the buffer 30 ; writes the detected synchronized transaction record 50 , with EM 60 ,
	  from the buffer to the magnetic tape as data set 80 ; continuing the gap with or without separator
	  signals 90 until a subsequently received synchronized transaction 51 -LRB- data set 81 -RRB- is
	  written to the magnetic tape following the separator signals , and this may leave an elongated gap
	  which comprises an unrecorded gap and\/or written separator signals 90 -LRB- e.g. , DSS -RRB- to the
	  magnetic tape following the written synchronized transaction record 50 -LRB- data set 80 -RRB- ; and
	  repeats the detection of a synchronized received transaction -LRB- e.g. , record 51 -RRB- , writing
	  the detected synchronized transaction -LRB- as <np> data </np> set 81 -RRB- , and writing the gap of
	  separator signals -LRB- e.g. , separator signals 91 -RRB- , etc. , for each succeeding detected
	  synchronized received transaction , such that the tape is moved longitudinally during the repeated
	  writing without stopping .
	- 3 for the four illustrated synchronized transaction records 50-53 , the next synchronized received
	  transaction 52 is detected , and is written as <np> data </np> set 82 , and the gap separator
	  signals -LRB- e.g. , separator signals 92 -RRB- are typically written for some or all of the
	  distance until the next detected synchronized received transaction 53 is written as data set 83 ,
	  etc.
	- 3 for the four illustrated synchronized transaction records 50-53 , the next synchronized received
	  transaction 52 is detected , and is written as data set 82 , and the gap separator signals -LRB-
	  e.g. , separator signals 92 -RRB- are typically written for some or all of the distance until the
	  next detected synchronized received transaction 53 is written as <np> data </np> set 83 , etc.
	- Additionally , the <np> data </np> will not be lost even in the event of a subsequent permanent
	  write error preventing recursive rewrite .
	- -LRB- 0059 -RRB- The point at which the accumulated synchronized <np> data </np> is recursively
	  written may comprise the termination of the pattern of synchronously written transactions , may
	  comprise a predetermined threshold , such as the limit of capacity of the buffer 30 to accumulate
	  data records , or may comprise the limit of capacity on tape for the work space which holds work
	  copies 80-83 and their separation signals 90-92 .
	- The partial data set is obtained from the <np> data </np> accumulated in the buffer 30 of FIG .
	- Thus , a transaction of one or more records , shown as record 50 , is written separately in <np>
	  data </np> set 120 , followed by an End Marker 300 as comprising a partial data set .
	- The subsequent transaction 51 is appended to the accumulated transaction 50 in <np> data </np> set
	  121 which is written , causing transaction 50 -LRB- or the last part of transaction 50 if it
	  includes previous data sets -RRB- to be rewritten and the appended transaction 51 to be written to
	  tape , so that there is a concentration of the transactions .
	- As data set 121 is also a partial data set , End Marker 301 is written , and the <np> data </np> set
	  121 is followed by DSS 131 , and transaction 51 is accumulated in the buffer .
	- Once a data set has been filled , it is again rewritten , such as <np> data </np> set 122 , and ,
	  after that filled data set is written once , it does not need to be written again on the work wraps
	  .
	- -LRB- 0066 -RRB- For example , the write pass indicator of data set 121 for transaction 50 , when
	  rewritten for the first time , is incremented to `` WP1 '' , and the write pass indicator for <np>
	  data </np> set 122 in which transaction 50 is rewritten a second time , is incremented to `` WP2 ''
	  .
	- 1 , 3 , 4 and 6 , in step 200 , <np> data </np> is received at interface 21 and , in step 201 , is
	  stored in buffer 30 .
	- Step 203 detects whether the <np> data </np> is accompanied by or followed by a synchronizing event
	  , such that the transaction is to be synchronized .
	- If not , the <np> data </np> is written to the magnetic tape 14 employing a normal algorithm in step
	  205 , for example , writing the data at a time selected by the tape drive , typically to maximize
	  streaming , which may entail delaying the start of writing , in sequence , each data set separated
	  from the previous data set by a DSS .
	- Once the end of data for , the transaction is sensed and the <np> data </np> has been written to
	  tape in steps 207 and 208 , in step 210 the controller 18 signals command complete .
	- 3 , the detected synchronized data record or records 50 , with EM 60 , is written from the buffer to
	  the magnetic tape as <np> data </np> set 80 , and in FIG .
	- 4 as <np> data </np> set 120 .
	- 3 separator signals 90 following <np> data </np> set 80 , in FIG .
	- 4 separator signals 130 following <np> data </np> set 120 -RRB- , continuing the gap and\/or
	  separator signals 90 , 130 until , as determined by step 212 and steps 203 and 205 or 207 cause a
	  subsequently received transaction 51 -LRB- data set 81 in FIG .
	- 6 thus repeats the detection of synchronized received transactions -LRB- e.g. , illustrated as
	  record 51 -RRB- , writing the detected synchronized transactions -LRB- as <np> data </np> set 81 ,
	  121 -RRB- , and writing the gaps and\/or separator signals -LRB- e.g. , separator signals 91 , 131
	  -RRB- , etc. , for each succeeding detected synchronized received transaction , such that the tape
	  is moved longitudinally during the repeated writing without stopping .
	- -LRB- 0084 -RRB- Since the <np> data </np> has been recursively written to tape , the work copies
	  are no longer required , and the copies in the buffer are no longer required .
	- -LRB- 0085 -RRB- As discussed above , the purpose of `` synchronizing '' <np> data </np> is , in
	  order to release the staging buffer , to have an assurance that the data has actually been recorded
	  on the magnetic tape 14 , and is not just in a volatile DRAM storage , such as buffer 30 , and
	  thereby insure that the data will not be lost if power to the buffer or to the drive is lost .
	- -LRB- 0085 -RRB- As discussed above , the purpose of `` synchronizing '' data is , in order to
	  release the staging buffer , to have an assurance that the <np> data </np> has actually been
	  recorded on the magnetic tape 14 , and is not just in a volatile DRAM storage , such as buffer 30 ,
	  and thereby insure that the data will not be lost if power to the buffer or to the drive is lost .
	- -LRB- 0085 -RRB- As discussed above , the purpose of `` synchronizing '' data is , in order to
	  release the staging buffer , to have an assurance that the data has actually been recorded on the
	  magnetic tape 14 , and is not just in a volatile DRAM storage , such as buffer 30 , and thereby
	  insure that the <np> data </np> will not be lost if power to the buffer or to the drive is lost .
	- If the <np> data </np> is `` synchronized '' , the tape drive is required to not return `` Command
	  Complete '' to a write type of command , or an indication-that the command has been or will be
	  successfully executed , until it has actually committed the data to media , specifically , the
	  magnetic tape 14 .
	- If the data is `` synchronized '' , the tape drive is required to not return `` Command Complete ''
	  to a write type of command , or an indication-that the command has been or will be successfully
	  executed , until it has actually committed the <np> data </np> to media , specifically , the
	  magnetic tape 14 .
	- Once the <np> data </np> has been written to the magnetic tape , if power is lost , the data can be
	  recovered from the tape , whereas it may not be recoverable from a volatile DRAM storage of the tape
	  drive buffer .
	- Once the data has been written to the magnetic tape , if power is lost , the <np> data </np> can be
	  recovered from the tape , whereas it may not be recoverable from a volatile DRAM storage of the tape
	  drive buffer .
	- Additionally , the <np> data </np> will not be lost even in the event of a subsequent permanent
	  write error preventing recursive rewrite .
	- As discussed above , the data region is typically filled with <np> data </np> , but , in some
	  instances , the active data is terminated with an `` End Mark '' .
	- In order to read the <np> data </np> , the compressed data is read from the magnetic tape , and must
	  subsequently be decompressed .
	- In order to read the data , the compressed <np> data </np> is read from the magnetic tape , and must
	  subsequently be decompressed .
	- -LRB- 0088 -RRB- In the illustrated embodiment , the <np> data </np> set 400 is terminated with an
	  uncompressed data set information table 302 .
	- In one example , upon a synchronized transaction partially filling a data set , and the partially
	  filled <np> data </np> set rewritten in a succeeding data set with an appended synchronized
	  transaction , a moving access point in the table of the succeeding data set identifies the appended
	  synchronized transaction , thereby skipping the rewritten transaction .
	- 13 , field 310 of the data set information table , in a portion of the field , identifies the <np>
	  data </np> set as having a synchronized transaction of a detected pattern .
	- If the data set information table were provided in all data sets of the tape , these bits , and much
	  of the remainder of the non-standard fields , may be set to all zero , or `` 0 '' , in the <np> data
	  </np> sets not having synchronized transactions of a detected pattern .
	- 4 , partially fills a data set , such as <np> data </np> set 120 , as discussed above , the
	  controller rewrites the partially filled data set in a succeeding data set , such as data set 121 .
	- 4 , partially fills a data set , such as data set 120 , as discussed above , the controller rewrites
	  the partially filled <np> data </np> set in a succeeding data set , such as data set 121 .
	- 4 , partially fills a data set , such as data set 120 , as discussed above , the controller rewrites
	  the partially filled data set in a succeeding data set , such as <np> data </np> set 121 .
	- Thus , in a read recovery process , the process would read record 50 at the access point 140 of <np>
	  data </np> set 120 , and would skip the rewritten synchronized transaction 50 in data set 121 .
	- Thus , in a read recovery process , the process would read record 50 at the access point 140 of data
	  set 120 , and would skip the rewritten synchronized transaction 50 in <np> data </np> set 121 .
	- 4 , in the instance where the transactions comprise compressed information , in a read recovery of
	  the partially filled data set and the succeeding data set , the written synchronized transaction 50
	  is read and decompressed from the partially filled <np> data </np> set 120 , the rewritten
	  synchronized transaction of the succeeding data set is skipped due to the moving access point 141 ,
	  and the appended synchronized transaction 51 is read and decompressed from the succeeding data set
	  121 .
	- 13 , the moving access point in field 313 of the data set information table 302 of <np> data </np>
	  set 122 of FIG .
	- -LRB- 0099 -RRB- In a read recovery of the partially filled data set and the succeeding data set ,
	  the written synchronized transaction 50 is read and decompressed from the partially filled <np> data
	  </np> set 120 , transaction 51 is read and decompressed from data set 121 by beginning decompression
	  at the moving access point 141 to skip over rewritten transaction 50 , the rewritten synchronized
	  transactions 50 and 51 of the succeeding data set 122 are skipped due to the moving access point 142
	  , and the appended synchronized transaction 52 is read and decompressed from the succeeding data
	  sets 122 and 123 .
	- -LRB- 0099 -RRB- In a read recovery of the partially filled data set and the succeeding data set ,
	  the written synchronized transaction 50 is read and decompressed from the partially filled data set
	  120 , transaction 51 is read and decompressed from <np> data </np> set 121 by beginning
	  decompression at the moving access point 141 to skip over rewritten transaction 50 , the rewritten
	  synchronized transactions 50 and 51 of the succeeding data set 122 are skipped due to the moving
	  access point 142 , and the appended synchronized transaction 52 is read and decompressed from the
	  succeeding data sets 122 and 123 .
	- 13 for <np> data </np> set 151 of FIG .
	- -LRB- 0120 -RRB- Step 271 then determines that there is now an existing partial data set with at
	  least one accumulated synchronized transaction , and , in step 278 , rewrites the accumulated
	  transaction -LRB- s -RRB- of the data set , incrementing the write pass indicator for the <np> data
	  </np> set in step 280 , and appending the present synchronized transaction to the rewritten
	  accumulated transactions in step 283 .
	- 4 , the subsequent transaction 51 is appended to the accumulated transaction 50 and the rewritten
	  accumulated transaction 50 and the new synchronized transaction are written as <np> data </np> set
	  121 , followed by DSS 131 , and step 275 returns to step 225 of FIG .
	- 4 , the incrementing the write passes an additional time to , e.g. , to `` WP3 '' for <np> data
	  </np> set 145 , etc. , superseding the identified separately written synchronized transactions of
	  the data sets 121-123 .
	- 4 , partially fills a data set , such as <np> data </np> set 120 , as discussed above , the
	  controller rewrites the partially filled data set in a succeeding data set , such as data set 121 .

	- 4 , partially fills a data set , such as data set 120 , as discussed above , the controller rewrites
	  the partially filled data set in a succeeding data set , such as <np> data </np> set 121 .
	- Thus , in a read recovery process the process would read record 50 at the normal access point 140 of
	  <np> data </np> set 120 , and would skip the rewritten synchronized transaction 50 in data set 121 .
	- Thus , in a read recovery process the process would read record 50 at the normal access point 140 of
	  data set 120 , and would skip the rewritten synchronized transaction 50 in <np> data </np> set 121 .
	- -LRB- 0136 -RRB- Thus , upon a failure requiring a read recovery , the data set information table of
	  the data sets prior to the failure provide a robust set of information allowing the tracing of the
	  data sets and an implementation of the read recovery process to recover the <np> data </np> .

	- If a <np> transaction </np> only partially fills a data set , that data set is rewritten in a
	  succeeding data set , appending the next transaction .
	- If a transaction only partially fills a data set , that data set is rewritten in a succeeding data

	- -LRB- 0008 -RRB- Herein , writing any data record , group of records , or other mark , is defined as
	  a `` <np> transaction </np> '' , and writing such data record , etc. , as the result of a

	  a `` transaction '' , and writing such data record , etc. , as the result of a synchronizing event
	  is defined as a `` synchronized <np> transaction </np> '' .
	- -LRB- 0009 -RRB- A difficulty with respect to magnetic tape is that the data is recorded
	  sequentially without long gaps between data sets , whereas synchronized transactions are stored in
	  separate bursts for each synchronizing event , with a noticeable time period before writing the next
	  <np> transaction </np> .
	- This requires that the tape drive `` backhitch '' after writing the synchronized transaction in
	  order to write the next <np> transaction </np> closely following the preceding transaction .
	- Hence , a backhitch requires that the tape be stopped , reversed to beyond the end of the previous
	  transaction , stopped again , and accelerated up to speed in the original direction before the next
	  <np> transaction </np> can be written to the tape .
	- -LRB- 0015 -RRB- The controller detects a pattern of synchronizing events for writing the
	  transactions to the magnetic tape as synchronized transactions ; writes the synchronized
	  transactions to the magnetic tape as written synchronized transactions , in the form of data sets ,
	  each data set having a data set information table ; and in the event one of the written synchronized
	  transactions , or the end of a transaction , partially fills a data set , rewrites the partially
	  filled data set in a succeeding data set , and appends a subsequent synchronized transaction in the
	  succeeding data set as an appended synchronized <np> transaction </np> ; and establishes a moving
	  access point for the succeeding data set in the data set information table of the succeeding data
	  set , the moving access point identifying the appended synchronized transaction , thereby skipping
	  the rewritten synchronized transaction .
	- -LRB- 0016 -RRB- In a further embodiment , wherein the transactions comprise compressed information
	  , in a read recovery of the partially filled data set and the succeeding data set , the written
	  synchronized <np> transaction </np> is read and decompressed from the partially filled data set ,
	  the rewritten synchronized transaction of the succeeding data set is skipped due to the moving
	  access point , and the appended synchronized transaction is read and decompressed from the
	  succeeding data set .
	- -LRB- 0016 -RRB- In a further embodiment , wherein the transactions comprise compressed information

	  synchronized transaction of the succeeding data set is skipped due to the moving access point , and
	  the appended synchronized <np> transaction </np> is read and decompressed from the succeeding data
	  set .
	- -LRB- 0047 -RRB- However , if the data is synchronized , it must be immediately written to tape from
	  the buffer , and only after the synchronized <np> transaction </np> has been written to tape is the
	  transaction erased from the buffer and overwritten , such that it can not be the subject of a
	  continuous data flow .

	  transaction </np> erased from the buffer and overwritten , such that it can not be the subject of a
	  continuous data flow .
	- As the result , after one data set is written for a synchronized <np> transaction </np> , in the
	  prior art of FIG .
	- Typically , a <np> transaction </np> will comprise hundreds of records , but only transactions of
	  one record each are illustrated for descriptive purposes herein .
	- Typically , each synchronized <np> transaction </np> is formatted as a separate data set , and is
	  illustrated in FIG .
	- -LRB- 0052 -RRB- In one aspect of the present invention , the controller 18 detects a synchronized
	  received <np> transaction </np> , e.g. , transaction record 50 of FIG .
	- 3 , stored in the buffer 30 ; writes the detected synchronized transaction record 50 , with EM 60 ,
	  from the buffer to the magnetic tape as data set 80 ; continuing the gap with or without separator
	  signals 90 until a subsequently received synchronized <np> transaction </np> 51 -LRB- data set 81
	  -RRB- is written to the magnetic tape following the separator signals , and this may leave an
	  elongated gap which comprises an unrecorded gap and\/or written separator signals 90 -LRB- e.g. ,
	  DSS -RRB- to the magnetic tape following the written synchronized transaction record 50 -LRB- data
	  set 80 -RRB- ; and repeats the detection of a synchronized received transaction -LRB- e.g. , record
	  51 -RRB- , writing the detected synchronized transaction -LRB- as data set 81 -RRB- , and writing
	  the gap of separator signals -LRB- e.g. , separator signals 91 -RRB- , etc. , for each succeeding
	  detected synchronized received transaction , such that the tape is moved longitudinally during the
	  repeated writing without stopping .
	- 3 for the four illustrated synchronized transaction records 50-53 , the next synchronized received
	  <np> transaction </np> 52 is detected , and is written as data set 82 , and the gap separator
	  signals -LRB- e.g. , separator signals 92 -RRB- are typically written for some or all of the
	  distance until the next detected synchronized received transaction 53 is written as data set 83 ,
	  etc.
	- 3 for the four illustrated synchronized transaction records 50-53 , the next synchronized received
	  transaction 52 is detected , and is written as data set 82 , and the gap separator signals -LRB-
	  e.g. , separator signals 92 -RRB- are typically written for some or all of the distance until the
	  next detected synchronized received <np> transaction </np> 53 is written as data set 83 , etc.
	- As discussed above , the typical synchronized transaction is written to tape , and then the <np>
	  transaction </np> is erased from the host system with the assurance that the transaction has been
	  written and will not be lost even as the result of a power loss .
	- As discussed above , the typical synchronized transaction is written to tape , and then the
	  transaction is erased from the host system with the assurance that the <np> transaction </np> has
	  been written and will not be lost even as the result of a power loss .
	- -LRB- 0057 -RRB- In accordance with the present invention , the controller 18 writes each detected
	  synchronized <np> transaction </np> , illustrated as a record 50-53 , of the detected pattern from
	  the buffer to the magnetic tape 14 , e.g. , as data sets 80-83 , above .
	- Upon writing each synchronized transaction of the detected pattern from the buffer to the magnetic
	  tape , the controller accumulates the synchronized <np> transaction </np> in the buffer 30 ; and
	  subsequently recursively writes the accumulated transactions from the buffer to the magnetic tape in
	  a sequence , e.g. , illustrated as data sets 100 , 101 .
	- 3 , the controller separately writes each synchronized <np> transaction </np> 50-53 from the buffer
	  to the magnetic tape , in the example as data sets 80-83 , and identifies each separately written
	  synchronized transaction , for example , by means of an access point 110-113 .
	- 3 , the controller separately writes each synchronized transaction 50-53 from the buffer to the
	  magnetic tape , in the example as data sets 80-83 , and identifies each separately written
	  synchronized <np> transaction </np> , for example , by means of an access point 110-113 .
	- 4 , wherein the controller writes each synchronized <np> transaction </np> 50-53 of the detected
	  pattern of synchronizing events from the buffer to the magnetic tape by writing data sets of
	  transactions , and , for any partial data set that was not filled upon writing a transaction ,
	  rewriting the partial data set and appending the next synchronized transaction that is being written
	  .
	- 4 , wherein the controller writes each synchronized transaction 50-53 of the detected pattern of
	  synchronizing events from the buffer to the magnetic tape by writing data sets of transactions , and
	  , for any partial data set that was not filled upon writing a transaction , rewriting the partial
	  data set and appending the next synchronized <np> transaction </np> that is being written .
	- Thus , a <np> transaction </np> of one or more records , shown as record 50 , is written separately
	  in data set 120 , followed by an End Marker 300 as comprising a partial data set .
	- Then , the DSS 130 is written , and the <np> transaction </np> is accumulated in buffer 30 .
	- The subsequent transaction 51 is appended to the accumulated <np> transaction </np> 50 in data set
	  121 which is written , causing transaction 50 -LRB- or the last part of transaction 50 if it
	  includes previous data sets -RRB- to be rewritten and the appended transaction 51 to be written to
	  tape , so that there is a concentration of the transactions .
	- The subsequent transaction 51 is appended to the accumulated transaction 50 in data set 121 which is
	  written , causing transaction 50 -LRB- or the last part of transaction 50 if it includes previous
	  data sets -RRB- to be rewritten and the appended <np> transaction </np> 51 to be written to tape ,
	  so that there is a concentration of the transactions .
	- As data set 121 is also a partial data set , End Marker 301 is written , and the data set 121 is
	  followed by DSS 131 , and <np> transaction </np> 51 is accumulated in the buffer .
	- The process continues as the subsequent transaction 52 is appended to the accumulated transactions
	  50 and 51 of the partial data set , and the rewritten accumulated transactions 50 , 51 and the
	  synchronized <np> transaction </np> 52 are written as data sets 122 and 123 , etc. .
	- -LRB- 0063 -RRB- In accordance with the present invention , a moving access point identifies a
	  synchronized <np> transaction </np> appended to a rewritten synchronized transaction , thereby
	  allowing skipping the rewritten synchronized transaction in a read recovery process , as will be
	  discussed .
	- -LRB- 0063 -RRB- In accordance with the present invention , a moving access point identifies a
	  synchronized transaction appended to a rewritten synchronized <np> transaction </np> , thereby
	  allowing skipping the rewritten synchronized transaction in a read recovery process , as will be
	  discussed .
	- -LRB- 0066 -RRB- For example , the write pass indicator of data set 121 for <np> transaction </np>
	  50 , when rewritten for the first time , is incremented to `` WP1 '' , and the write pass indicator
	  for data set 122 in which transaction 50 is rewritten a second time , is incremented to `` WP2 '' .
	- -LRB- 0066 -RRB- For example , the write pass indicator of data set 121 for transaction 50 , when
	  rewritten for the first time , is incremented to `` WP1 '' , and the write pass indicator for data
	  set 122 in which <np> transaction </np> 50 is rewritten a second time , is incremented to `` WP2 ''
	  .
	- The controller additionally identifies the recursively written transactions as the most current copy
	  thereof , incrementing the write pass for the data set 145 containing <np> transaction </np> 50 an
	  additional time to `` WP3 '' , and incrementing the write pass for the data set 146 containing part
	  of the rewritten transaction 52 to `` WP3 '' .
	- In accordance with the resent invention , access points 141 and 142 are moving access points which
	  identify a synchronized <np> transaction </np> appended to a rewritten synchronized transaction ,
	  thereby allowing skipping the rewritten synchronized transaction in a read recovery process , as
	  will be discussed .
	- In accordance with the resent invention , access points 141 and 142 are moving access points which
	  identify a synchronized transaction appended to a rewritten synchronized <np> transaction </np> ,
	  thereby allowing skipping the rewritten synchronized transaction in a read recovery process , as
	  will be discussed .
	- Thus , <np> transaction </np> 50 is indicated by access point 140 , transaction 51 is indicated by a
	  moving access point 141 , etc. .
	- Thus , transaction 50 is indicated by access point 140 , <np> transaction </np> 51 is indicated by a
	  moving access point 141 , etc. .
	- Step 203 detects whether the data is accompanied by or followed by a synchronizing event , such that
	  the <np> transaction </np> is to be synchronized .
	- In step 207 , the synchronized <np> transaction </np> is written to tape , either as part of the
	  pattern as will be discussed , or as a single transaction .
	- Step 208 determines whether the end of data for the <np> transaction </np> has been reached and , if
	  not , cycles back to step 207 to continue writing the data .
	- Once the end of data for , the <np> transaction </np> is sensed and the data has been written to
	  tape in steps 207 and 208 , in step 210 the controller 18 signals command complete .
	- 4 separator signals 130 following data set 120 -RRB- , continuing the gap and\/or separator signals
	  90 , 130 until , as determined by step 212 and steps 203 and 205 or 207 cause a subsequently
	  received <np> transaction </np> 51 -LRB- data set 81 in FIG .
	- -LRB- 0080 -RRB- In accordance with the present invention , upon detecting a pattern of
	  synchronizing events in step 220 , the controller 18 , in step 223 , separately and completely
	  writes each detected synchronized <np> transaction </np> 50-53 of the detected pattern from the
	  buffer to the magnetic tape 14 , in the manner of the process of FIG .
	- -LRB- 0081 -RRB- In step 225 , upon writing each synchronized transaction from the buffer to the
	  magnetic tape , the controller accumulates the synchronized <np> transaction </np> in the buffer 30
	  , providing a command complete in step 226 .
	- If the pattern is continuing , the process cycles back to step 223 to write the next synchronized
	  <np> transaction </np> .
	- In one example , upon a synchronized <np> transaction </np> partially filling a data set , and the
	  partially filled data set rewritten in a succeeding data set with an appended synchronized
	  transaction , a moving access point in the table of the succeeding data set identifies the appended
	  synchronized transaction , thereby skipping the rewritten transaction .
	- In one example , upon a synchronized transaction partially filling a data set , and the partially
	  filled data set rewritten in a succeeding data set with an appended synchronized <np> transaction
	  </np> , a moving access point in the table of the succeeding data set identifies the appended
	  synchronized transaction , thereby skipping the rewritten transaction .
	- In one example , upon a synchronized transaction partially filling a data set , and the partially
	  filled data set rewritten in a succeeding data set with an appended synchronized transaction , a
	  moving access point in the table of the succeeding data set identifies the appended synchronized
	  <np> transaction </np> , thereby skipping the rewritten transaction .
	- In still another example , the data set information table of a recursively written synchronized <np>
	  transaction </np> provides a backwards pointer to a longitudinal position on the magnetic tape of a
	  written work copy data set .
	- The controller appends a subsequent synchronized transaction , such as record 51 to the rewritten
	  synchronized <np> transaction </np> 50 in the succeeding data set 121 as an appended synchronized
	  transaction .
	- The controller appends a subsequent synchronized transaction , such as record 51 to the rewritten
	  synchronized transaction 50 in the succeeding data set 121 as an appended synchronized <np>
	  transaction </np> .
	- The moving access point is an offset , for example , from the beginning of the data set , that
	  identifies the appended synchronized <np> transaction </np> , the new data , and is shown as moving
	  access point 141 in FIG .
	- Thus , in a read recovery process , the process would read record 50 at the access point 140 of data
	  set 120 , and would skip the rewritten synchronized <np> transaction </np> 50 in data set 121 .
	- 4 , in the instance where the transactions comprise compressed information , in a read recovery of
	  the partially filled data set and the succeeding data set , the written synchronized <np>
	  transaction </np> 50 is read and decompressed from the partially filled data set 120 , the rewritten
	  synchronized transaction of the succeeding data set is skipped due to the moving access point 141 ,
	  and the appended synchronized transaction 51 is read and decompressed from the succeeding data set
	  121 .
	- 4 , in the instance where the transactions comprise compressed information , in a read recovery of
	  the partially filled data set and the succeeding data set , the written synchronized transaction 50
	  is read and decompressed from the partially filled data set 120 , the rewritten synchronized
	  transaction of the succeeding data set is skipped due to the moving access point 141 , and the
	  appended synchronized <np> transaction </np> 51 is read and decompressed from the succeeding data
	  set 121 .
	- The controller appends a subsequent synchronized transaction , such as <np> transaction </np> 52 to
	  the rewritten synchronized transactions 50 and 51 in the succeeding data set 122 as an appended
	  synchronized transaction .
	- The controller appends a subsequent synchronized transaction , such as transaction 52 to the
	  rewritten synchronized transactions 50 and 51 in the succeeding data set 122 as an appended

	  moving access point 141 to skip over rewritten <np> transaction </np> 50 , the rewritten
	  synchronized transactions 50 and 51 of the succeeding data set 122 are skipped due to the moving
	  access point 142 , and the appended synchronized transaction 52 is read and decompressed from the
	  succeeding data sets 122 and 123 .

	- A portion of the field indicates that the data set is a synchronized <np> transaction </np> .
	- 13 , and the <np> transaction </np> is identified with an access point .
	- 3 , each separately written synchronized <np> transaction </np> 50-53 is identified by means of an
	  access point 110-113 , and , in FIG .
	- 4 , separately written <np> transaction </np> 50 is identified by means of a normal access point 140
	  .
	- As an example , the <np> transaction </np> appears as record or records 50 in partial data set 120
	  of FIG .
	- 13 in step 340 , and the <np> transaction </np> is identified with an access point .
	- 4 , separately written <np> transaction </np> 50 is identified by means of a normal access point 140

	- 10 with the next synchronized <np> transaction </np> .
	- -LRB- 0120 -RRB- Step 271 then determines that there is now an existing partial data set with at
	  least one accumulated synchronized <np> transaction </np> , and , in step 278 , rewrites the
	  accumulated transaction -LRB- s -RRB- of the data set , incrementing the write pass indicator for
	  the data set in step 280 , and appending the present synchronized transaction to the rewritten

	- -LRB- 0120 -RRB- Step 271 then determines that there is now an existing partial data set with at

	  transaction </np> -LRB- s -RRB- of the data set , incrementing the write pass indicator for the data

	- 4 , the subsequent transaction 51 is appended to the accumulated <np> transaction </np> 50 and the
	  rewritten accumulated transaction 50 and the new synchronized transaction are written as data set

	- Also , the write pass indicators or access points are updated , and the <np> transaction </np> is
	  identified with a moving access point .
	- The controller appends a subsequent synchronized transaction , such as record 51 to the rewritten

	- The moving access point is an offset , for example , from the beginning of the data set , that

	- -LRB- 0003 -RRB- <np> Magnetic tape </np> provides a means for physically storing data which may be
	  archived or which may be stored in storage shelves of automated data storage libraries and accessed
	  when required .
	- Data stored in this manner has an aspect of permanence which allows copies of the data stored in
	  memory or disk at a host system to be erased , knowing that a copy exists on <np> magnetic tape
	  </np> .
	- -LRB- 0005 -RRB- `` Synchronized data '' is defined as data or other information which is subject to
	  a `` synchronizing event '' or similar command requiring the tape drive to not return `` Command
	  Complete '' to a write type of command , or an indication that the command has been or will be
	  successfully executed , until it has actually committed the data to media , specifically , the <np>
	  magnetic tape </np> .
	- -LRB- 0009 -RRB- A difficulty with respect to <np> magnetic tape </np> is that the data is recorded
	  sequentially without long gaps between data sets , whereas synchronized transactions are stored in
	  separate bursts for each synchronizing event , with a noticeable time period before writing the next
	  transaction .
	- -LRB- 0010 -RRB- Briefly , the cross referenced application , as pointed out by the abstract ,
	  writes synchronized data to <np> magnetic tape </np> while reducing the number of backhitches .
	- A controller detects a pattern of synchronizing events for received data records to be written to
	  tape ; writes each transaction of data records to the <np> magnetic tape </np> ; accumulates the
	  synchronized transactions in a buffer ; and subsequently recursively writes the accumulated
	  transactions of data records from the buffer to the magnetic tape in a sequence .
	- A controller detects a pattern of synchronizing events for received data records to be written to
	  tape ; writes each transaction of data records to the magnetic tape ; accumulates the synchronized
	  transactions in a buffer ; and subsequently recursively writes the accumulated transactions of data
	  records from the buffer to the <np> magnetic tape </np> in a sequence .
	- -LRB- 0012 -RRB- In accordance with the present invention , a recording system for a magnetic tape
	  drive , a magnetic tape drive , and a method are provided for receiving data to be written to the
	  <np> magnetic tape </np> .
	- -LRB- 0013 -RRB- The magnetic tape drive has at least one motor for moving a magnetic tape
	  longitudinally ; and has at least one read\/write head for reading from and for writing to the <np>

	  longitudinally ; and has at least one read\/write head for reading from and for writing to the
	  magnetic tape while the <np> magnetic tape </np> is moved longitudinally by the at least one motor .
	- -LRB- 0014 -RRB- In one embodiment , the magnetic tape drive recording system comprises at least one
	  recording channel receiving data to be written to the <np> magnetic tape </np> , the data in the
	  form of transactions , the recording channel -LRB- s -RRB- for operating the read\/write head -LRB-

	  for writing transactions to the <np> magnetic tape </np> ; and a controller operating the motor
	  -LRB- s -RRB- , and the recording channel -LRB- s -RRB- .
	- -LRB- 0015 -RRB- The controller detects a pattern of synchronizing events for writing the
	  transactions to the <np> magnetic tape </np> as synchronized transactions ; writes the synchronized
	  transactions to the magnetic tape as written synchronized transactions , in the form of data sets ,
	  each data set having a data set information table ; and in the event one of the written synchronized
	  transactions , or the end of a transaction , partially fills a data set , rewrites the partially
	  filled data set in a succeeding data set , and appends a subsequent synchronized transaction in the
	  succeeding data set as an appended synchronized transaction ; and establishes a moving access point
	  for the succeeding data set in the data set information table of the succeeding data set , the
	  moving access point identifying the appended synchronized transaction , thereby skipping the
	  rewritten synchronized transaction .
	- -LRB- 0015 -RRB- The controller detects a pattern of synchronizing events for writing the
	  transactions to the magnetic tape as synchronized transactions ; writes the synchronized
	  transactions to the <np> magnetic tape </np> as written synchronized transactions , in the form of
	  data sets , each data set having a data set information table ; and in the event one of the written
	  synchronized transactions , or the end of a transaction , partially fills a data set , rewrites the
	  partially filled data set in a succeeding data set , and appends a subsequent synchronized
	  transaction in the succeeding data set as an appended synchronized transaction ; and establishes a
	  moving access point for the succeeding data set in the data set information table of the succeeding
	  data set , the moving access point identifying the appended synchronized transaction , thereby
	  skipping the rewritten synchronized transaction .
	- -LRB- 0017 -RRB- In a still further embodiment in which the <np> magnetic tape </np> has a plurality
	  of wraps ; the controller writes the synchronized transactions to work copy wraps of the magnetic
	  tape , likely in the form of spaced apart data sets , each data set having a data set information
	  table .
	- -LRB- 0017 -RRB- In a still further embodiment in which the magnetic tape has a plurality of wraps ;
	  the controller writes the synchronized transactions to work copy wraps of the <np> magnetic tape
	  </np> , likely in the form of spaced apart data sets , each data set having a data set information
	  table .
	- Data set information tables are additionally provided for data sets of subsequently recursively

	- -LRB- 0020 -RRB- In another embodiment , the controller initially writes at least one data set of
	  the synchronized transactions to the <np> magnetic tape </np> as a normal wrap data set before
	  switching to the work copy wraps , the data set also having a data set information table .
	- Additionally , the number representing a thread for the synchronized transactions of the detected
	  pattern , comprises the write pass number of the last data set having a transaction of the pattern

	  employing the prior art methodology with backhitches ;
	- 3 is a diagrammatic illustration of synchronized data written on <np> magnetic tape </np> employing
	  one embodiment of the present invention ;
	- 4 is a diagrammatic illustration of synchronized data written on <np> magnetic tape </np> employing
	  an alternative embodiment of the present invention ;
	- 5 is a diagrammatic illustration of synchronized data written on <np> magnetic tape </np> having a
	  plurality of wraps , and employing separate accumulating backhitchless wraps for storing a work copy
	  in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention ;
	- -LRB- 0040 -RRB- The magnetic tape cartridge 11 may be inserted in the tape drive 10 , and loaded by
	  the tape drive so that one or more read and\/or write heads 23 of the recording system reads and\/or
	  writes information with respect to the <np> magnetic tape </np> 14 as the tape is moved
	  longitudinally by one or more motors 25 .
	- Also as known to those of skill in the art , the recording system comprises a wrap control system 27
	  to electronically switch to another set of read and\/or write heads , and\/or to seek and move the
	  read and\/or write heads 23 laterally of the <np> magnetic tape </np> , to position the heads at a
	  desired wrap or wraps , and , in some embodiments , to track follow the desired wrap or wraps .
	- -LRB- 0041 -RRB- Controller 18 also provides the data flow and formatting of data to be read from
	  and written to the <np> magnetic tape </np> , employing a buffer 30 and a recording channel 32 , as
	  is known to those of skill in the art .
	- -LRB- 0042 -RRB- As discussed above , <np> magnetic tape </np> provides a means for physically
	  storing data which may be archived or which may be stored in storage shelves of automated data
	  storage libraries and accessed when required .
	- This permanence allows copies of the data stored in memory or disk at the host system 20 to be
	  erased , knowing that a correct copy exists on <np> magnetic tape </np> .
	- -LRB- 0044 -RRB- In order to release the staging buffer , it is necessary to have an assurance that
	  the data has actually been recorded on the <np> magnetic tape </np> 14 , and is not just in a
	  volatile DRAM storage , such as buffer 30 , and may be lost if power to the buffer or to the drive
	  is lost .
	- Thus , it is often desirable to `` synchronize '' the data , requiring the tape drive to not return
	  `` Command Complete '' to a write type of command , or an indication that the command has been or
	  will be successfully executed , until it has actually committed the data to media , specifically ,
	  the <np> magnetic tape </np> 14 .
	- Once the data has been written to the <np> magnetic tape </np> , if power is lost , the data can be
	  recovered from the tape , whereas it may not be recoverable from a volatile DRAM storage of the tape
	  drive buffer .
	- 2 , data is typically recorded on <np> magnetic tape </np> sequentially with only short gaps between
	  data sets , for example between data sets 31 and 32 , 32 and 33 , etc. .
	- 1 , comprises at least one buffer 30 for storing data in the form of data transactions to be written
	  to <np> magnetic tape </np> 14 , at least one recording channel 32 coupled to the buffer for
	  operating at least one read\/write head 23 for writing transactions from the buffer to the magnetic
	  tape , and at least one controller 18 .
	- 1 , comprises at least one buffer 30 for storing data in the form of data transactions to be written
	  to magnetic tape 14 , at least one recording channel 32 coupled to the buffer for operating at least
	  one read\/write head 23 for writing transactions from the buffer to the <np> magnetic tape </np> ,
	  and at least one controller 18 .
	- 3 , stored in the buffer 30 ; writes the detected synchronized transaction record 50 , with EM 60 ,
	  from the buffer to the <np> magnetic tape </np> as data set 80 ; continuing the gap with or without
	  separator signals 90 until a subsequently received synchronized transaction 51 -LRB- data set 81
	  -RRB- is written to the magnetic tape following the separator signals , and this may leave an
	  elongated gap which comprises an unrecorded gap and\/or written separator signals 90 -LRB- e.g. ,
	  DSS -RRB- to the magnetic tape following the written synchronized transaction record 50 -LRB- data
	  set 80 -RRB- ; and repeats the detection of a synchronized received transaction -LRB- e.g. , record
	  51 -RRB- , writing the detected synchronized transaction -LRB- as data set 81 -RRB- , and writing
	  the gap of separator signals -LRB- e.g. , separator signals 91 -RRB- , etc. , for each succeeding
	  detected synchronized received transaction , such that the tape is moved longitudinally during the
	  repeated writing without stopping .
	- 3 , stored in the buffer 30 ; writes the detected synchronized transaction record 50 , with EM 60 ,
	  from the buffer to the magnetic tape as data set 80 ; continuing the gap with or without separator
	  signals 90 until a subsequently received synchronized transaction 51 -LRB- data set 81 -RRB- is
	  written to the <np> magnetic tape </np> following the separator signals , and this may leave an
	  elongated gap which comprises an unrecorded gap and\/or written separator signals 90 -LRB- e.g. ,
	  DSS -RRB- to the magnetic tape following the written synchronized transaction record 50 -LRB- data
	  set 80 -RRB- ; and repeats the detection of a synchronized received transaction -LRB- e.g. , record
	  51 -RRB- , writing the detected synchronized transaction -LRB- as data set 81 -RRB- , and writing
	  the gap of separator signals -LRB- e.g. , separator signals 91 -RRB- , etc. , for each succeeding
	  detected synchronized received transaction , such that the tape is moved longitudinally during the
	  repeated writing without stopping .
	- 3 , stored in the buffer 30 ; writes the detected synchronized transaction record 50 , with EM 60 ,
	  from the buffer to the magnetic tape as data set 80 ; continuing the gap with or without separator
	  signals 90 until a subsequently received synchronized transaction 51 -LRB- data set 81 -RRB- is
	  written to the magnetic tape following the separator signals , and this may leave an elongated gap
	  which comprises an unrecorded gap and\/or written separator signals 90 -LRB- e.g. , DSS -RRB- to the
	  <np> magnetic tape </np> following the written synchronized transaction record 50 -LRB- data set 80
	  -RRB- ; and repeats the detection of a synchronized received transaction -LRB- e.g. , record 51
	  -RRB- , writing the detected synchronized transaction -LRB- as data set 81 -RRB- , and writing the
	  gap of separator signals -LRB- e.g. , separator signals 91 -RRB- , etc. , for each succeeding
	  detected synchronized received transaction , such that the tape is moved longitudinally during the
	  repeated writing without stopping .
	- 1 and 3 , space on the <np> magnetic tape </np> is saved by recursively writing the synchronized
	  data .
	- -LRB- 0056 -RRB- First , the controller 18 detects a pattern of synchronized transactions to be
	  written to the <np> magnetic tape </np> 14 .
	- -LRB- 0057 -RRB- In accordance with the present invention , the controller 18 writes each detected
	  synchronized transaction , illustrated as a record 50-53 , of the detected pattern from the buffer
	  to the <np> magnetic tape </np> 14 , e.g. , as data sets 80-83 , above .
	- Upon writing each synchronized transaction of the detected pattern from the buffer to the <np>
	  magnetic tape </np> , the controller accumulates the synchronized transaction in the buffer 30 ; and
	  subsequently recursively writes the accumulated transactions from the buffer to the magnetic tape in
	  a sequence , e.g. , illustrated as data sets 100 , 101 .
	- Upon writing each synchronized transaction of the detected pattern from the buffer to the magnetic
	  tape , the controller accumulates the synchronized transaction in the buffer 30 ; and subsequently
	  recursively writes the accumulated transactions from the buffer to the <np> magnetic tape </np> in a
	  sequence , e.g. , illustrated as data sets 100 , 101 .
	- -LRB- 0058 -RRB- Thus , the synchronized transactions 50-53 have been immediately written to the
	  <np> magnetic tape </np> 14 , and preserved against a power loss at the buffer 30 , as work copies
	  in data sets 80-83 , while also being accumulated in buffer 30 , and then recursively written to
	  immediately follow the preceding data 99 in data sets 100 , 101 , saving space .
	- 3 , the controller separately writes each synchronized transaction 50-53 from the buffer to the <np>
	  magnetic tape </np> , in the example as data sets 80-83 , and identifies each separately written
	  synchronized transaction , for example , by means of an access point 110-113 .
	- 4 , wherein the controller writes each synchronized transaction 50-53 of the detected pattern of
	  synchronizing events from the buffer to the <np> magnetic tape </np> by writing data sets of
	  transactions , and , for any partial data set that was not filled upon writing a transaction ,
	  rewriting the partial data set and appending the next synchronized transaction that is being written
	  .
	- 5 , in still another embodiment , where the <np> magnetic tape </np> comprises a plurality of wraps
	  , such as in an LTO system as discussed above , the controller 18 of FIG .
	- -LRB- 0070 -RRB- In one embodiment , the controller 18 designates a plurality of wraps of the <np>
	  magnetic tape </np> 14 as work copy wraps 180 , 181 , and , upon detecting a pattern of
	  synchronizing events , determines whether access to the work copy wraps requires a seek , or may be
	  conducted electronically , switching to a different set of read\/write heads .
	- If not , the data is written to the <np> magnetic tape </np> 14 employing a normal algorithm in step
	  205 , for example , writing the data at a time selected by the tape drive , typically to maximize
	  streaming , which may entail delaying the start of writing , in sequence , each data set separated
	  from the previous data set by a DSS .
	- 3 , the detected synchronized data record or records 50 , with EM 60 , is written from the buffer to
	  the <np> magnetic tape </np> as data set 80 , and in FIG .
	- -LRB- 0077 -RRB- In step 211 , the controller 18 leaves a gap and\/or writes separator signals -LRB-
	  e.g. , DSS -RRB- to the <np> magnetic tape </np> following the written synchronized data record 50
	  -LRB- in FIG .
	- 4 -RRB- to be written to the <np> magnetic tape </np> following the separator signals .
	- 1 , 3 , 4 and 7 , space on the <np> magnetic tape </np> is saved by recursively writing the
	  synchronized data .
	- -LRB- 0079 -RRB- First , in step 220 , the controller 18 detects a pattern of synchronizing events
	  for transactions to be written to the <np> magnetic tape </np> 14 .
	- -LRB- 0080 -RRB- In accordance with the present invention , upon detecting a pattern of
	  synchronizing events in step 220 , the controller 18 , in step 223 , separately and completely
	  writes each detected synchronized transaction 50-53 of the detected pattern from the buffer to the
	  <np> magnetic tape </np> 14 , in the manner of the process of FIG .
	- -LRB- 0081 -RRB- In step 225 , upon writing each synchronized transaction from the buffer to the
	  <np> magnetic tape </np> , the controller accumulates the synchronized transaction in the buffer 30
	  , providing a command complete in step 226 .
	- -LRB- 0083 -RRB- Upon either the accumulated transaction threshold being reached in step 230 , or
	  upon reaching the end of the pattern of synchronizing events in step 231 , in step 233 , the
	  controller recursively writes the accumulated transactions from the buffer to the <np> magnetic tape
	  </np> in a sequence , e.g. , illustrated as data sets 100 , 101 in FIG .
	- -LRB- 0085 -RRB- As discussed above , the purpose of `` synchronizing '' data is , in order to
	  release the staging buffer , to have an assurance that the data has actually been recorded on the
	  <np> magnetic tape </np> 14 , and is not just in a volatile DRAM storage , such as buffer 30 , and
	  thereby insure that the data will not be lost if power to the buffer or to the drive is lost .
	- If the data is `` synchronized '' , the tape drive is required to not return `` Command Complete ''
	  to a write type of command , or an indication-that the command has been or will be successfully
	  executed , until it has actually committed the data to media , specifically , the <np> magnetic tape
	  </np> 14 .
	- Once the data has been written to the <np> magnetic tape </np> , if power is lost , the data can be
	  recovered from the tape , whereas it may not be recoverable from a volatile DRAM storage of the tape
	  drive buffer .
	- In order to read the data , the compressed data is read from the <np> magnetic tape </np> , and must
	  subsequently be decompressed .
	- As one example , the thread for the synchronized transactions of the detected pattern , comprises
	  the write pass number 308 of the last data set having a transaction of the pattern written to the
	  <np> magnetic tape </np> as a normal wrap data set , and before the work copy synchronized
	  transaction data sets are written .
	- -LRB- 0105 -RRB- As discussed above , the controller writes the synchronized transactions to work
	  copy wraps of the <np> magnetic tape </np> , likely in the form of spaced apart data sets .
	- Data set information tables are additionally provided for data sets of subsequently recursively
	  written synchronized transactions , which are copies of the synchronized transactions written to the
	  <np> magnetic tape </np> in a sequence of data sets .
	- In the example the thread comprises the write pass number of the last data set having a transaction
	  of the pattern written to the <np> magnetic tape </np> as a normal wrap data set , and before the
	  work copy synchronized transaction data sets are written .
	- 5 and 8 , in step 245 , the controller determines whether the <np> magnetic tape </np> comprises a
	  plurality of wraps , such as in an LTO system as discussed above , and whether the work copies are
	  to be written to at least one of the plurality of wraps that is separate from a wrap of the
	  recursive writing .
	- In step 261 , the work copy of each synchronized transaction , e.g. , of transactions 50-53 , of the
	  pattern is written separately from the buffer to the <np> magnetic tape </np> , either as
	  illustrated in FIG .
	- As one example , as discussed above , the thread for the synchronized transactions of the detected
	  pattern , comprises the write pass number 308 of the last data set having a transaction of the
	  pattern written to the <np> magnetic tape </np> as a normal wrap data set , and before the work copy
	  synchronized transaction data sets are written .
	- As discussed above , the controller writes the synchronized transactions to work copy wraps of the
	  <np> magnetic tape </np> , likely in the form of spaced apart data sets .
	- The data sets of subsequently recursively written synchronized transactions are copies of the
	  synchronized transactions written to the <np> magnetic tape </np> in a sequence of data sets .

	  for moving a magnetic tape longitudinally ; said magnetic tape drive having at least one read\/write

	  operating said at least one motor , and said at least one recording channel , said controller :
	- at least one recording channel receiving said data to be written to said magnetic tape , said data
	  in the form of transactions , and said at least one recording channel for operating said at least

	  operating said at least one motor , and said at least one recording channel , said controller :
	- detects a pattern of synchronizing events for writing said transactions to said <np> magnetic tape
	  </np> as synchronized transactions ; writes said synchronized transactions to said magnetic tape as
	  written synchronized transactions , in the form of data sets , each data set having a data set
	  information table ; in the event one of said written synchronized transactions partially fills a
	  data set , rewrites said partially filled data set in a succeeding data set , appends a subsequent
	  said synchronized transaction in said succeeding data set as an appended synchronized transaction ;
	  and establishes a moving access point for said succeeding data set in said data set information

	- Special fields for error recovery are provided in data set information tables of data sets written
	  with synchronized <np> transactions </np> .
	- -LRB- 0009 -RRB- A difficulty with respect to magnetic tape is that the data is recorded
	  sequentially without long gaps between data sets , whereas synchronized <np> transactions </np> are
	  stored in separate bursts for each synchronizing event , with a noticeable time period before
	  writing the next transaction .
	- A controller detects a pattern of synchronizing events for received data records to be written to
	  tape ; writes each transaction of data records to the magnetic tape ; accumulates the synchronized
	  <np> transactions </np> in a buffer ; and subsequently recursively writes the accumulated
	  transactions of data records from the buffer to the magnetic tape in a sequence .
	- -LRB- 0015 -RRB- The controller detects a pattern of synchronizing events for writing the
	  transactions to the magnetic tape as synchronized transactions ; writes the synchronized <np>
	  transactions </np> to the magnetic tape as written synchronized transactions , in the form of data
	  sets , each data set having a data set information table ; and in the event one of the written
	  synchronized transactions , or the end of a transaction , partially fills a data set , rewrites the
	  partially filled data set in a succeeding data set , and appends a subsequent synchronized
	  transaction in the succeeding data set as an appended synchronized transaction ; and establishes a
	  moving access point for the succeeding data set in the data set information table of the succeeding
	  data set , the moving access point identifying the appended synchronized transaction , thereby
	  skipping the rewritten synchronized transaction .
	- -LRB- 0015 -RRB- The controller detects a pattern of synchronizing events for writing the
	  transactions to the magnetic tape as synchronized transactions ; writes the synchronized
	  transactions to the magnetic tape as written synchronized transactions , in the form of data sets ,
	  each data set having a data set information table ; and in the event one of the written synchronized
	  <np> transactions </np> , or the end of a transaction , partially fills a data set , rewrites the
	  partially filled data set in a succeeding data set , and appends a subsequent synchronized
	  transaction in the succeeding data set as an appended synchronized transaction ; and establishes a
	  moving access point for the succeeding data set in the data set information table of the succeeding
	  data set , the moving access point identifying the appended synchronized transaction , thereby
	  skipping the rewritten synchronized transaction .
	- -LRB- 0016 -RRB- In a further embodiment , wherein the <np> transactions </np> comprise compressed
	  information , in a read recovery of the partially filled data set and the succeeding data set , the
	  written synchronized transaction is read and decompressed from the partially filled data set , the
	  rewritten synchronized transaction of the succeeding data set is skipped due to the moving access
	  point , and the appended synchronized transaction is read and decompressed from the succeeding data
	  set .
	- -LRB- 0017 -RRB- In a still further embodiment in which the magnetic tape has a plurality of wraps ;
	  the controller writes the synchronized <np> transactions </np> to work copy wraps of the magnetic
	  tape , likely in the form of spaced apart data sets , each data set having a data set information
	  table .
	- Data set information tables are additionally provided for data sets of subsequently recursively
	  written synchronized <np> transactions </np> , which are copies of the synchronized transactions
	  written to the magnetic tape in a sequence of data sets .
	- -LRB- 0018 -RRB- The controller provides , in the data set information table of each data set for
	  the synchronized <np> transactions </np> , a number representing a thread for the synchronized
	  transactions of the detected pattern ; provides the status of the data set ; and provides an
	  identification of the wrap of the immediately succeeding data set of the synchronized transactions ,
	  if any , as a forward pointer .
	- The controller additionally provides , for the recursively written synchronized <np> transactions
	  </np> , a backwards pointer to a longitudinal position on the magnetic tape of a written work copy
	  data set .
	- Hence , synchronized <np> transactions </np> instead must be written immediately in separate bursts
	  for each synchronization event .
	- Typically , a transaction will comprise hundreds of records , but only <np> transactions </np> of
	  one record each are illustrated for descriptive purposes herein .
	- Thus , there is no backhitch , the tape drive continues to write the synchronized <np> transactions
	  </np> without stopping .
	- To preserve the synchronized <np> transactions </np> 50-53 in the event that power is lost , the
	  data sets 80-83 are considered as work copies of the transactions .
	- Once the <np> transactions </np> have been recursively rewritten , the work copies may be
	  overwritten .
	- Upon writing each synchronized transaction of the detected pattern from the buffer to the magnetic
	  tape , the controller accumulates the synchronized transaction in the buffer 30 ; and subsequently
	  recursively writes the accumulated <np> transactions </np> from the buffer to the magnetic tape in a
	  sequence , e.g. , illustrated as data sets 100 , 101 .
	- The recursive writing may comprise a backhitch to place the recursively written accumulated <np>
	  transactions </np> following the preceding data 99 with the nominal gap .
	- -LRB- 0058 -RRB- Thus , the synchronized <np> transactions </np> 50-53 have been immediately written
	  to the magnetic tape 14 , and preserved against a power loss at the buffer 30 , as work copies in
	  data sets 80-83 , while also being accumulated in buffer 30 , and then recursively written to
	  immediately follow the preceding data 99 in data sets 100 , 101 , saving space .
	- Once the <np> transactions </np> have been recursively written , the work copies 80-83 may be
	  overwritten .
	- -LRB- 0059 -RRB- The point at which the accumulated synchronized data is recursively written may
	  comprise the termination of the pattern of synchronously written <np> transactions </np> , may
	  comprise a predetermined threshold , such as the limit of capacity of the buffer 30 to accumulate
	  data records , or may comprise the limit of capacity on tape for the work space which holds work
	  copies 80-83 and their separation signals 90-92 .
	- -LRB- 0061 -RRB- The controller additionally identifies the recursively written <np> transactions
	  </np> as the most current copy thereof , employing a new access point 115 , superseding the
	  identified separately written synchronized transactions of the data sets 80-83 .
	- Alternatively or additionally , the write pass indication `` WP '' for each data set may be
	  incremented to indicate that the recursively written <np> transactions </np> are each the most
	  recent copy , superseding the identified separately written synchronized transactions of the data
	  sets 80-83 .
	- The process continues as the subsequent transaction 52 is appended to the accumulated <np>
	  transactions </np> 50 and 51 of the partial data set , and the rewritten accumulated transactions 50
	  , 51 and the synchronized transaction 52 are written as data sets 122 and 123 , etc. .
	- The process continues as the subsequent transaction 52 is appended to the accumulated transactions
	  50 and 51 of the partial data set , and the rewritten accumulated <np> transactions </np> 50 , 51
	  and the synchronized transaction 52 are written as data sets 122 and 123 , etc. .
	- -LRB- 0065 -RRB- Subsequently , upon recursively writing the data sets , the controller additionally
	  identifies the recursively written <np> transactions </np> as the most current copies thereof , for
	  example by further incrementing the write pass `` WP '' for the data sets , superseding the written
	  and\/or identified rewritten and appended written synchronized transactions .
	- The controller then recursively writes the <np> transactions </np> 50-53 as data sets 145 and 146 .
	- The controller additionally identifies the recursively written <np> transactions </np> as the most
	  current copy thereof , incrementing the write pass for the data set 145 containing transaction 50 an
	  additional time to `` WP3 '' , and incrementing the write pass for the data set 146 containing part
	  of the rewritten transaction 52 to `` WP3 '' .
	- The controller recursively writes the <np> transactions </np> 50-53 as data sets 145 and 146 , and
	  additionally identifies the recursively written transactions as the most current copy thereof ,
	  employing an access point 148 , superseding the identified separately written synchronized
	  transactions of the data sets 120-123 .
	- The controller recursively writes the transactions 50-53 as data sets 145 and 146 , and additionally
	  identifies the recursively written <np> transactions </np> as the most current copy thereof ,
	  employing an access point 148 , superseding the identified separately written synchronized
	  transactions of the data sets 120-123 .
	- -LRB- 0069 -RRB- Specifically , in the example , the pattern of synchronously written <np>
	  transactions </np> is detected after data sets 150 and 151 have been written on standard wrap 160 in
	  the direction of arrow 161 .
	- The goal of any such algorithm is to reach the original append point -LRB- to recursively write the
	  <np> transactions </np> -RRB- when the buffer is full of accumulated synchronized transactions .
	- Thus , there is no backhitch , and the tape drive continues to write the <np> transactions </np>
	  without stopping except to reverse directions in the accumulating backhitchless flush wraps , if
	  necessary , along with a seek to a second accumulating backhitchless flush wrap .
	- To preserve the <np> transactions </np> 50-53 in the event that power is lost , the data sets 80-83
	  are considered as work copies of the transactions .
	- Once the <np> transactions </np> have been recursively written , the work copies may be overwritten
	  .
	- -LRB- 0079 -RRB- First , in step 220 , the controller 18 detects a pattern of synchronizing events
	  for <np> transactions </np> to be written to the magnetic tape 14 .
	- As discussed above , a pattern may comprise a predetermined number of consecutive synchronizing
	  events for <np> transactions </np> of less than a certain length .
	- -LRB- 0082 -RRB- Step 230 determines whether the accumulated <np> transactions </np> have reached a
	  predetermined threshold .
	- As discussed above , examples of predetermined threshold may comprise the limit of capacity of the
	  buffer 30 to accumulate <np> transactions </np> , or may comprise the limit of capacity of the work
	  space for the work copies 80-83 and their separation signals 90-92 .
	- -LRB- 0083 -RRB- Upon either the accumulated transaction threshold being reached in step 230 , or
	  upon reaching the end of the pattern of synchronizing events in step 231 , in step 233 , the
	  controller recursively writes the accumulated <np> transactions </np> from the buffer to the
	  magnetic tape in a sequence , e.g. , illustrated as data sets 100 , 101 in FIG .
	- The recursive writing may comprise a backhitch to place the recursively written accumulated <np>
	  transactions </np> following the preceding data 99 .
	- Hence , in step 235 , the accumulated <np> transactions </np> are released to allow this section of
	  the buffer to be overwritten , as is known to those of skill in the art .
	- In another example , each data set information table provides a thread for the synchronized <np>
	  transactions </np> , provides the status of the data set within the sequence of the synchronized
	  transaction process , and identifies the wrap of the immediately succeeding data set of the
	  synchronized transactions , to provide a recovery trail .
	- Other standard information is the Tape Write Pass 308 , which is employed as discussed above for
	  synchronized <np> transactions </np> in accordance with the present invention , as the write pass
	  indication `` WP '' for each data set that may be incremented to indicate that the recursively
	  written transactions are each the most recent copy , superseding the identified separately written
	  synchronized transactions .
	- Other standard information is the Tape Write Pass 308 , which is employed as discussed above for
	  synchronized transactions in accordance with the present invention , as the write pass indication ``
	  WP '' for each data set that may be incremented to indicate that the recursively written <np>
	  transactions </np> are each the most recent copy , superseding the identified separately written
	  synchronized transactions .
	- Other standard information is the Tape Write Pass 308 , which is employed as discussed above for
	  synchronized transactions in accordance with the present invention , as the write pass indication ``
	  WP '' for each data set that may be incremented to indicate that the recursively written
	  transactions are each the most recent copy , superseding the identified separately written
	  synchronized <np> transactions </np> .
	- Specifically , in the event one of the written synchronized <np> transactions </np> , or the end of
	  a transaction , such as record 50 of FIG .
	- 4 , in the instance where the <np> transactions </np> comprise compressed information , in a read
	  recovery of the partially filled data set and the succeeding data set , the written synchronized
	  transaction 50 is read and decompressed from the partially filled data set 120 , the rewritten
	  synchronized transaction of the succeeding data set is skipped due to the moving access point 141 ,
	  and the appended synchronized transaction 51 is read and decompressed from the succeeding data set
	  121 .
	- This saves having to read and decompress <np> transactions </np> twice during the recovery process .
	- 4 , data set 121 , is also partially filled by <np> transactions </np> 50 and 51 .
	- This saves having to read and decompress <np> transactions </np> twice or more during the recovery
	  process .
	- -LRB- 0105 -RRB- As discussed above , the controller writes the synchronized <np> transactions </np>
	  to work copy wraps of the magnetic tape , likely in the form of spaced apart data sets .
	- Data set information tables are additionally provided for data sets of subsequently recursively
	  written synchronized <np> transactions </np> , which are copies of the synchronized transactions
	  written to the magnetic tape in a sequence of data sets .
	- In step 261 , the work copy of each synchronized transaction , e.g. , of <np> transactions </np>
	  50-53 , of the pattern is written separately from the buffer to the magnetic tape , either as
	  illustrated in FIG .
	- 8 determines that the work copies are to be written as appended to rewritten accumulated
	  synchronized <np> transactions </np> , connector 270 leads to FIG .
	- -LRB- 0120 -RRB- Step 271 then determines that there is now an existing partial data set with at
	  least one accumulated synchronized transaction , and , in step 278 , rewrites the accumulated
	  transaction -LRB- s -RRB- of the data set , incrementing the write pass indicator for the data set
	  in step 280 , and appending the present synchronized transaction to the rewritten accumulated <np>
	  transactions </np> in step 283 .
	- 7 , the controller additionally identifies the recursively written <np> transactions </np> as the
	  most current copy thereof , employing in the separately written embodiment of FIG .
	- Specifically , in the event one of the written synchronized <np> transactions </np> , such as record
	  50 of FIG .
	- As discussed above , the controller writes the synchronized <np> transactions </np> to work copy
	  wraps of the magnetic tape , likely in the form of spaced apart data sets .
	- The data sets of subsequently recursively written synchronized <np> transactions </np> are copies of
	  the synchronized transactions written to the magnetic tape in a sequence of data sets .
	- detects a pattern of synchronizing events for writing said <np> transactions </np> to said magnetic
	  tape as synchronized transactions ; writes said synchronized transactions to said magnetic tape as
	  written synchronized transactions , in the form of data sets , each data set having a data set
	  information table ; in the event one of said written synchronized transactions partially fills a
	  data set , rewrites said partially filled data set in a succeeding data set , appends a subsequent
	  said synchronized transaction in said succeeding data set as an appended synchronized transaction ;
	  and establishes a moving access point for said succeeding data set in said data set information

?	panel	US5040845A

	- A panel -LRB- 3 -RRB- is slidably guided in the longitudinal guides -LRB- 4 -RRB- such that the <np>
	  panel </np> -LRB- 3 -RRB- is adapted to be slid from a closed position in which it closes the roof
	  opening -LRB- 2 -RRB- both rearwardly and forwardly under the fixed roof -LRB- 1 -RRB- to open the
	  roof opening -LRB- 2 -RRB- .
	- The type of sliding roof that was best able to meet these requirements is the so-called tilt-sliding
	  roof , wherein the <np> panel </np> is adapted to be moved between a closed position in the roof
	  opening and backwardly slid positions under the fixed roof on the one hand and between the closed
	  position and upwardly tilted inclined positions on the other hand .
	- For this purpose the invention proposes a sliding roof for a vehicle of which the fixed roof is
	  provided with a roof opening , comprising a longitudinal guide near both longitudinal edges of the
	  roof opening , and a <np> panel </np> being slidably guided in the longitudinal guides such that the
	  panel is adapted to be slid from a closed position in which it closes the roof opening both
	  rearwardly and forwardly with respect to the fixed roof to at least partially open the roof opening
	  .
	- For this purpose the invention proposes a sliding roof for a vehicle of which the fixed roof is
	  provided with a roof opening , comprising a longitudinal guide near both longitudinal edges of the
	  roof opening , and a panel being slidably guided in the longitudinal guides such that the <np> panel
	  </np> is adapted to be slid from a closed position in which it closes the roof opening both
	  rearwardly and forwardly with respect to the fixed roof to at least partially open the roof opening
	  .
	- Preferably , the <np> panel </np> is slid under the fixed roof .
	- As a result of the possibility to slide the <np> panel </np> from the closed position both
	  rearwardly and forwardly it is necessary to selectively provide an opening on the front and rear
	  side of the panel , as in a tilt-sliding roof .
	- Since the <np> panel </np> basically has to perform only a sliding movement it is sufficient to use
	  a relatively simple adjusting mechanism requiring little built-in height .
	- A very simple embodiment of the sliding roof according to the invention is characterized in that the
	  <np> panel </np> , in its closed position , is lying under the roof opening and a seal for the panel
	  extends downwardly from the fixed roof about the roof opening .
	- A very simple embodiment of the sliding roof according to the invention is characterized in that the
	  panel , in its closed position , is lying under the roof opening and a seal for the <np> panel </np>
	  extends downwardly from the fixed roof about the roof opening .
	- Principally , the <np> panel </np> can be supported directly by guide shoes that are slidably guided
	  in the longitudinal guide .
	- In this embodiment it is favorable if the <np> panel </np> is larger than the roof opening and the
	  seal engages on the upper side of the panel .
	- Because the <np> panel </np> is larger than the opening in the fixed roof the sliding roof is
	  extremely burglar proof since the panel can not be forced outwardly and , in case the panel is made
	  of glass , it is then only possible to break in the car through the sliding roof by smashing the
	  glass of the panel .

	  proof since the <np> panel </np> can not be forced outwardly and , in case the panel is made of
	  glass , it is then only possible to break in the car through the sliding roof by smashing the glass
	  of the panel .
	- A further embodiment of the sliding roof according to the invention is characterized in that the
	  <np> panel </np> , in its closed position , is lying within the roof opening and is moved first
	  downwardly from the closed position before it is slid backwardly and forwardly , respectively .
	- This embodiment it is advantageous when the substantially rectangular panel is supported near each
	  of the four corners by a slide through an adjusting means and wherein the slides are guided in the
	  respective longitudinal guide on either side of the panel , wherein it is possible that the
	  adjusting means comprises a lever pivotable about a horizontal transverse shaft and pivotally
	  connected to the <np> panel </np> at one end .
	- In an embodiment of the sliding roof wherein the <np> panel </np> is made of transparent material ,
	  such as glass , and there is also provided a slidable sunshade , it is favorable when the
	  longitudinal guides are attached to a stationary frame and wherein the panel is slidable rearwardly
	  and forwardly between the frame and the fixed roof , and the sunshade is slidable rearwardly between
	  the frame and a roof lining of the vehicle .
	- In an embodiment of the sliding roof wherein the panel is made of transparent material , such as
	  glass , and there is also provided a slidable sunshade , it is favorable when the longitudinal
	  guides are attached to a stationary frame and wherein the <np> panel </np> is slidable rearwardly
	  and forwardly between the frame and the fixed roof , and the sunshade is slidable rearwardly between
	  the frame and a roof lining of the vehicle .
	- A remarkably simple embodiment of the sliding roof according to the present invention is
	  characterized in that the longitudinal guide is attached directly to the vehicle , and front and
	  rear water gutters being slidably guided in the longitudinal guide such that , in the closed
	  position of the panel , the front and rear water gutters are lying under the front and rear edges ,
	  respectively of the roof opening while , in the rearwardly displaced positions of the panel , the
	  rear water gutter moves along with the <np> panel </np> and while , in forwardly displaced positions
	  , the front water gutter moves along with the panel .
	- A remarkably simple embodiment of the sliding roof according to the present invention is
	  characterized in that the longitudinal guide is attached directly to the vehicle , and front and
	  rear water gutters being slidably guided in the longitudinal guide such that , in the closed
	  position of the panel , the front and rear water gutters are lying under the front and rear edges ,
	  respectively of the roof opening while , in the rearwardly displaced positions of the panel , the
	  rear water gutter moves along with the panel and while , in forwardly displaced positions , the
	  front water gutter moves along with the <np> panel </np> .
	- A special embodiment of the sliding roof according to the invention is characterized in that the
	  <np> panel </np> is provided with a wind deflector near its rear side .
	- The wind deflector is positioned in a operative position and moves along with the <np> panel </np>
	  when the panel is in forwardly displaced positions .
	- The wind deflector is positioned in a operative position and moves along with the panel when the
	  <np> panel </np> is in forwardly displaced positions .
	- 14 is a perspective exploded view of one of the support and adjusting means of the adjusting
	  mechanism for the <np> panel </np> .
	- The sliding roof comprises a <np> panel </np> 3 which , in the embodiment shown by way of example ,
	  is made of a transparent material such as glass , but which can also be made of non-transparent
	  material such as metal .
	- According to the invention , the <np> panel </np> 3 is additionally permitted to be slid from the
	  closed position of FIG .
	- 4-6 basically the <np> panel </np> 3 is slid only within one plane in the longitudinal direction of
	  the vehicle .
	- 4 the <np> panel </np> 3 is positioned under the roof opening 2 .
	- For this purpose it is favorable when the <np> panel </np> 3 is slightly larger than the roof
	  opening 2 .
	- In this way the sliding roof is extremely burglar proof since the burglary is then only possible by
	  smashing in the <np> panel </np> .
	- 4-6 that the <np> panel </np> 3 is flush with the fixed roof 1 of the vehicle in its closed position
	  .
	- An example of such an adjusting means for the <np> panel </np> 3 will be elucidated in more detail
	  with reference to FIG .
	- At the front edge of the roof opening 2 there is provided a wind deflector 13 adjustable in vertical
	  direction and being positioned in the upper operative position when the <np> panel </np> 3 is
	  displaced rearwardly from the closed position , and being positioned in a lower in operative
	  position when the panel 3 is in a closed position or is displaced forwardly from this closed
	  position .
	- At the front edge of the roof opening 2 there is provided a wind deflector 13 adjustable in vertical
	  direction and being positioned in the upper operative position when the panel 3 is displaced
	  rearwardly from the closed position , and being positioned in a lower in operative position when the
	  <np> panel </np> 3 is in a closed position or is displaced forwardly from this closed position .
	- According to the invention , there can be arranged a rear wind deflector 14 on the rear side of the
	  panel 3 , the rear wind deflector 14 being in a upper operative position and follows the sliding
	  movements of the panel 3 when the <np> panel </np> 3 is displaced forwardly from the closed position
	  .
	- This realizes the same effect as with a <np> panel </np> that is moved into a backwardly and
	  upwardly inclined venting position , that is , when the vehicle is driving , to produce a vacuum
	  behind the rear edge of the panel 3 so that air is permitted to be sucked out of the interior of the
	  vehicle .
	- When the <np> panel </np> 3 is closed or is displaced rearwardly from the closed position , the rear
	  wind deflector 14 is in a lower inoperative position in which it follows the sliding movements of
	  the panel 3 .
	- Between both longitudinal guides there extend not only the <np> panel </np> 3 but also two
	  transverse water gutters 15 and 16 respectively .
	- When the <np> panel </np> 3 is displaced from the closed position rearwardly , there is effected a
	  coupling between the panel and the rear water gutter 16 so that the rear water gutter 16 slides with
	  the panel 3 while the front water gutter 15 remains under the front edge of the roof opening 2 when
	  the panel 3 is in rearward displaced positions .
	- When the panel 3 is displaced from the closed position rearwardly , there is effected a coupling
	  between the panel and the rear water gutter 16 so that the rear water gutter 16 slides with the <np>
	  panel </np> 3 while the front water gutter 15 remains under the front edge of the roof opening 2
	  when the panel 3 is in rearward displaced positions .
	- When the panel 3 is displaced from the closed position rearwardly , there is effected a coupling
	  between the panel and the rear water gutter 16 so that the rear water gutter 16 slides with the

	- For example , each <np> data set </np> has a Data Set Number 307 , which , in one example , is the
	  ordinal number of the data set from the beginning of tape .
	- Other standard information is the Tape Write Pass 308 , which is employed as discussed above for
	  synchronized transactions in accordance with the present invention , as the write pass indication ``

	  least one accumulated synchronized transaction , and , in step 278 , rewrites the accumulated
	  transaction -LRB- s -RRB- of the <np> data set </np> , incrementing the write pass indicator for the
	  data set in step 280 , and appending the present synchronized transaction to the rewritten
	  accumulated transactions in step 283 .

	  as the most current copy thereof in step 280 by means of an incremented write pass `` WP '' , as
	  discussed above .
	- In step 357 , the <np> data set </np> is identified in field 310 of the data set information table
	  302 of FIG .
	- For example , a <np> data set </np> may be a last data set on the normal wrap before switching to
	  the work copy wraps , may be the last work copy data set on a work copy wrap headed in a first
	  longitudinal direction , may be the last work copy on a second work copy wrap that is headed in the
	  opposite longitudinal direction , or may be the last recursively rewritten data set , such that the
	  process has been completed .
	- For example , a data set may be a last data set on the normal wrap before switching to the work copy
	  wraps , may be the last work copy data set on a work copy wrap headed in a first longitudinal
	  direction , may be the last work copy on a second work copy wrap that is headed in the opposite
	  longitudinal direction , or may be the last recursively rewritten <np> data set </np> , such that
	  the process has been completed .

	  controller rewrites the partially filled data set in a succeeding data set , such as data set 121 .
	- Thus , if , as is likely , the immediately succeeding data set is on the same wrap , the read
	  recovery process continues reading in the same direction of the same wrap until the next <np> data
	  set </np> is encountered .
	- Thus , step 366 first determines whether the <np> data set </np> is a recursively rewritten data set
	  , and step 367 determines the backwards pointer 317 of FIG .
	- Thus , step 366 first determines whether the data set is a recursively rewritten <np> data set </np>

	  succeeding data set .
	- -LRB- 0009 -RRB- A difficulty with respect to magnetic tape is that the data is recorded
	  sequentially without long gaps between <np> data sets </np> , whereas synchronized transactions are

	  writing the next transaction .
	- -LRB- 0017 -RRB- In a still further embodiment in which the magnetic tape has a plurality of wraps ;
	  the controller writes the synchronized transactions to work copy wraps of the magnetic tape , likely
	  in the form of spaced apart <np> data sets </np> , each data set having a data set information table
	  .
	- Data set information tables are additionally provided for <np> data sets </np> of subsequently

	  synchronized transaction , illustrated as a record 50-53 , of the detected pattern from the buffer
	  to the magnetic tape 14 , e.g. , as <np> data sets </np> 80-83 , above .
	- Upon writing each synchronized transaction of the detected pattern from the buffer to the magnetic
	  tape , the controller accumulates the synchronized transaction in the buffer 30 ; and subsequently
	  recursively writes the accumulated transactions from the buffer to the magnetic tape in a sequence ,
	  e.g. , illustrated as <np> data sets </np> 100 , 101 .
	- -LRB- 0058 -RRB- Thus , the synchronized transactions 50-53 have been immediately written to the
	  magnetic tape 14 , and preserved against a power loss at the buffer 30 , as work copies in <np> data
	  sets </np> 80-83 , while also being accumulated in buffer 30 , and then recursively written to

	- The process continues as the subsequent transaction 52 is appended to the accumulated transactions
	  50 and 51 of the partial data set , and the rewritten accumulated transactions 50 , 51 and the
	  synchronized transaction 52 are written as <np> data sets </np> 122 and 123 , etc. .
	- -LRB- 0065 -RRB- Subsequently , upon recursively writing the data sets , the controller additionally

	- -LRB- 0002 -RRB- This invention relates to storage of data to magnetic tape , and , more
	  particularly , to storage of synchronized data , data which is to be physically written to <np> tape
	  </np> before a command complete response can be made , so that the entity sending the data is able
	  to erase its data , knowing that a copy physically exists on magnetic tape .
	- As the result , if power is lost , the data can be recovered from the <np> tape </np> , whereas it
	  may not be recoverable from a volatile DRAM storage of the tape drive buffer .
	- This means that the drive is not to respond immediately , but instead is to respond when the command
	  has completed , meaning that any data sent as part of the command is written out to <np> tape </np>
	  .
	- A specialized case of a Write Filemark command is where the number of Filemarks field is also set to
	  `` 0 '' , meaning that the Write Filemark command has no data of its own , and all data which
	  precedes the command must be written to <np> tape </np> before a command complete is sent .
	- <np> Tape </np> is written or read while it is moved longitudinally at a constant speed .
	- Hence , a backhitch requires that the <np> tape </np> be stopped , reversed to beyond the end of the
	  previous transaction , stopped again , and accelerated up to speed in the original direction before
	  the next transaction can be written to the tape .
	- Hence , a backhitch requires that the tape be stopped , reversed to beyond the end of the previous
	  transaction , stopped again , and accelerated up to speed in the original direction before the next
	  transaction can be written to the <np> tape </np> .
	- A controller detects a pattern of synchronizing events for received data records to be written to
	  <np> tape </np> ; writes each transaction of data records to the magnetic tape ; accumulates the
	  synchronized transactions in a buffer ; and subsequently recursively writes the accumulated
	  transactions of data records from the buffer to the magnetic tape in a sequence .
	- -LRB- 0040 -RRB- The magnetic tape cartridge 11 may be inserted in the tape drive 10 , and loaded by
	  the tape drive so that one or more read and\/or write heads 23 of the recording system reads and\/or
	  writes information with respect to the magnetic tape 14 as the <np> tape </np> is moved
	  longitudinally by one or more motors 25 .
	- Once the data has been written to the magnetic tape , if power is lost , the data can be recovered
	  from the <np> tape </np> , whereas it may not be recoverable from a volatile DRAM storage of the
	  tape drive buffer .
	- This means that the drive is not to respond immediately , but instead is to respond when the command
	  has completed , meaning that any data sent as part of the command is written out to <np> tape </np>
	  .
	- A specialized case of a Write Filemark command is where the number of Filemarks field is also set to
	  `` 0 '' , meaning that the Write Filemark command has no data of its own , and the only meaning of
	  the command is that all data which precedes the command must be written to <np> tape </np> before a
	  command complete is sent .
	- As discussed above , the <np> tape </np> is written or read while motors 25 of FIG .
	- Only occasionally , typically when the buffer is empty , is the <np> tape </np> stopped .
	- -LRB- 0047 -RRB- However , if the data is synchronized , it must be immediately written to <np> tape
	  </np> from the buffer , and only after the synchronized transaction has been written to tape is the
	  transaction erased from the buffer and overwritten , such that it can not be the subject of a
	  continuous data flow .
	- -LRB- 0047 -RRB- However , if the data is synchronized , it must be immediately written to tape from
	  the buffer , and only after the synchronized transaction has been written to <np> tape </np> is the
	  transaction erased from the buffer and overwritten , such that it can not be the subject of a
	  continuous data flow .
	- 1 typically operates the servo system and motor drivers to stop the <np> tape </np> after the data
	  set .
	- Some finite distance and finite time is required to stop the <np> tape </np> , and the tape is then
	  `` backhitched '' , reversed to beyond the end of the previous data set , stopped again , and
	  accelerated up to speed in the original direction before the DSS and the next data set may be
	  written to the tape .
	- Some finite distance and finite time is required to stop the tape , and the <np> tape </np> is then
	  `` backhitched '' , reversed to beyond the end of the previous data set , stopped again , and
	  accelerated up to speed in the original direction before the DSS and the next data set may be
	  written to the tape .
	- Some finite distance and finite time is required to stop the tape , and the tape is then ``
	  backhitched '' , reversed to beyond the end of the previous data set , stopped again , and
	  accelerated up to speed in the original direction before the DSS and the next data set may be
	  written to the <np> tape </np> .
	- 3 , stored in the buffer 30 ; writes the detected synchronized transaction record 50 , with EM 60 ,
	  from the buffer to the magnetic tape as data set 80 ; continuing the gap with or without separator
	  signals 90 until a subsequently received synchronized transaction 51 -LRB- data set 81 -RRB- is
	  written to the magnetic tape following the separator signals , and this may leave an elongated gap
	  which comprises an unrecorded gap and\/or written separator signals 90 -LRB- e.g. , DSS -RRB- to the
	  magnetic tape following the written synchronized transaction record 50 -LRB- data set 80 -RRB- ; and
	  repeats the detection of a synchronized received transaction -LRB- e.g. , record 51 -RRB- , writing
	  the detected synchronized transaction -LRB- as data set 81 -RRB- , and writing the gap of separator
	  signals -LRB- e.g. , separator signals 91 -RRB- , etc. , for each succeeding detected synchronized
	  received transaction , such that the <np> tape </np> is moved longitudinally during the repeated
	  writing without stopping .
	- As discussed above , the typical synchronized transaction is written to <np> tape </np> , and then
	  the transaction is erased from the host system with the assurance that the transaction has been
	  written and will not be lost even as the result of a power loss .
	- -LRB- 0059 -RRB- The point at which the accumulated synchronized data is recursively written may
	  comprise the termination of the pattern of synchronously written transactions , may comprise a
	  predetermined threshold , such as the limit of capacity of the buffer 30 to accumulate data records
	  , or may comprise the limit of capacity on <np> tape </np> for the work space which holds work
	  copies 80-83 and their separation signals 90-92 .
	- The subsequent transaction 51 is appended to the accumulated transaction 50 in data set 121 which is
	  written , causing transaction 50 -LRB- or the last part of transaction 50 if it includes previous
	  data sets -RRB- to be rewritten and the appended transaction 51 to be written to <np> tape </np> ,
	  so that there is a concentration of the transactions .
	- Thus , a good working copy is fixed on the <np> tape </np> before the final set of transactions in
	  the example , are recursively written .
	- -LRB- 0071 -RRB- In another embodiment , once a work copy wrap has been selected , the controller 18
	  determines the present longitudinal position of the read write head along the <np> tape </np> , and
	  determines the writable space of the selected work copy wrap in each longitudinal direction from
	  that present longitudinal position .
	- In step 207 , the synchronized transaction is written to <np> tape </np> , either as part of the
	  pattern as will be discussed , or as a single transaction .
	- Once the end of data for , the transaction is sensed and the data has been written to <np> tape
	  </np> in steps 207 and 208 , in step 210 the controller 18 signals command complete .
	- 6 thus repeats the detection of synchronized received transactions -LRB- e.g. , illustrated as
	  record 51 -RRB- , writing the detected synchronized transactions -LRB- as data set 81 , 121 -RRB- ,
	  and writing the gaps and\/or separator signals -LRB- e.g. , separator signals 91 , 131 -RRB- , etc.
	  , for each succeeding detected synchronized received transaction , such that the <np> tape </np> is
	  moved longitudinally during the repeated writing without stopping .
	- -LRB- 0084 -RRB- Since the data has been recursively written to <np> tape </np> , the work copies
	  are no longer required , and the copies in the buffer are no longer required .
	- Once the data has been written to the magnetic tape , if power is lost , the data can be recovered
	  from the <np> tape </np> , whereas it may not be recoverable from a volatile DRAM storage of the
	  tape drive buffer .
	- Other standard information is the <np> Tape </np> Write Pass 308 , which is employed as discussed
	  above for synchronized transactions in accordance with the present invention , as the write pass
	  indication `` WP '' for each data set that may be incremented to indicate that the recursively
	  written transactions are each the most recent copy , superseding the identified separately written
	  synchronized transactions .

?	data set information table	US20030142429A1

	- Fields are provided in a <np> data set information table </np> for each data set of the synchronized
	  transactions for read recovery of the synchronized data .
	- -LRB- 0015 -RRB- The controller detects a pattern of synchronizing events for writing the
	  transactions to the magnetic tape as synchronized transactions ; writes the synchronized
	  transactions to the magnetic tape as written synchronized transactions , in the form of data sets ,
	  each data set having a <np> data set information table </np> ; and in the event one of the written
	  synchronized transactions , or the end of a transaction , partially fills a data set , rewrites the
	  partially filled data set in a succeeding data set , and appends a subsequent synchronized
	  transaction in the succeeding data set as an appended synchronized transaction ; and establishes a
	  moving access point for the succeeding data set in the data set information table of the succeeding
	  data set , the moving access point identifying the appended synchronized transaction , thereby
	  skipping the rewritten synchronized transaction .
	- -LRB- 0017 -RRB- In a still further embodiment in which the magnetic tape has a plurality of wraps ;
	  the controller writes the synchronized transactions to work copy wraps of the magnetic tape , likely
	  in the form of spaced apart data sets , each data set having a <np> data set information table </np>

	- The controller provides the status of the normal wrap data set in the <np> data set information
	  table </np> , identifying in the status , the last normal wrap data set .
	- In another example , each <np> data set information table </np> provides a thread for the

	  information table </np> may also be of a uniform size , and may be at a known location in the data

	  information 305 .

	  set information table </np> 302 .
	- -LRB- 0106 -RRB- Thus , the thread , the status , and the forward and backwards pointers comprise

	- A camera crane having a carriage , a crane post which is arranged above the carriage , and a <np>
	  boom </np> which is attached in such a manner that the boom can be tilted about a crane pivot axis ,
	  with sections of the boom extending on either side of the crane pivot axis .
	- A camera crane having a carriage , a crane post which is arranged above the carriage , and a boom
	  which is attached in such a manner that the <np> boom </np> can be tilted about a crane pivot axis ,
	  with sections of the boom extending on either side of the crane pivot axis .
	- The section of the boom which carries the counterweight has a smaller length than the length of the
	  crane post between carriage and crane pivot axis , and the <np> boom </np> has a pivot range about
	  the crane pivot axis of more than 180 ° .
	- This invention relates to a camera crane , having a moving carriage , a crane post arranged above
	  the truck , and a <np> boom </np> which is attached to the crane post to pivot about a crane pivot
	  axis , where the crane column has sections of the boom which extend on both sides of the crane pivot
	  axis , wherein a camera is attached at an end of one section of the boom , and on the other section
	  a moment-compensating counterweight is attached .
	- Camera cranes distinguished between so-called camera dollies , which allow the camera to be lifted
	  only a short distance but which can be moved with a carriage on rails or freely on a support , thus
	  allowing different movements of the camera , and larger camera cranes , which are usually located in
	  a fixed position and have the ability to move the camera by a <np> boom </np> .
	- In particular , it is considered a drawback with known camera cranes , that the <np> boom </np> can
	  only travel over a limited pivot range , which results in an undesirable restriction of the camera
	  movements which can be achieved .
	- Advantageously , the <np> boom </np> has on several parts several telescoping elements , which
	  jointly form the section which is used for the attachment of the camera , so that the length of the
	  section can be changed .
	- Thus , the camera attached to the <np> boom </np> can be raised to a great height by extending the
	  telescoping elements in the vertical arrangement of the boom , or in the case of a horizontal
	  orientation of the boom , it also allows movements over long distances , so that the camera dollies
	  which for these purposes were required in the past can be effectively replaced .
	- For the attachment of the camera to the <np> boom </np> , an attachment platform for the camera is
	  provided , which can be pivoted over a horizontal axis as well as over a vertical camera tilt axis ,
	  in order to account for the high range of inclination of the boom about the crane pivot axis , which
	  is achieved according to this invention .
	- To facilitate the transport of the camera crane according to this invention , the <np> boom </np> is
	  preferably attached to the crane post in a removable manner , which can be achieved by attaching the
	  boom to the side of the crane post , as explained in greater detail below .
	- An additional essential characteristic of the camera crane represented in the figures is that all
	  movements about the above-indicated axes S , V , H , N , R and D as well as those of the <np> boom
	  </np> in the direction of the arrow T1or in the opposite direction can be achieved by electric
	  motors and monitored by corresponding displacement sensors .

	  with a roof opening , comprising a panel which is displaceable between a closed position in the roof
	  opening and an open position .
	- The ever increasing demand for more comfort in the <np> vehicle </np> , in particular the passenger
	  car , has led to the situation that the sliding roof design always had to meet new and stricter
	  requirements .
	- For this purpose the invention proposes a sliding roof for a <np> vehicle </np> of which the fixed
	  roof is provided with a roof opening , comprising a longitudinal guide near both longitudinal edges
	  of the roof opening , and a panel being slidably guided in the longitudinal guides such that the
	  panel is adapted to be slid from a closed position in which it closes the roof opening both
	  rearwardly and forwardly with respect to the fixed roof to at least partially open the roof opening
	  .
	- A remarkably simple embodiment of the sliding roof according to the present invention is
	  characterized in that the longitudinal guide is attached directly to the <np> vehicle </np> , and
	  front and rear water gutters being slidably guided in the longitudinal guide such that , in the
	  closed position of the panel , the front and rear water gutters are lying under the front and rear
	  edges , respectively of the roof opening while , in the rearwardly displaced positions of the panel
	  , the rear water gutter moves along with the panel and while , in forwardly displaced positions ,
	  the front water gutter moves along with the panel .
	- Between the structure of the sliding roof and the mounting into the <np> vehicle </np> , the several
	  parts of the sliding roof may be fixed relatively to each other by means of a fixture or such tool .
	- This special wind deflector provides more or less an imitation of the inclined venting position of
	  the panel of a tilt-sliding roof wherein , when the <np> vehicle </np> is driving , a vacuum is
	  created on the rear side of the panel causing air to be sucked from the interior of the vehicle
	  thereby effectuating a good ventilation thereof .

	- This realizes the same effect as with a panel that is moved into a backwardly and upwardly inclined
	  venting position , that is , when the <np> vehicle </np> is driving , to produce a vacuum behind the
	  rear edge of the panel 3 so that air is permitted to be sucked out of the interior of the vehicle .
	- After this attachment the sliding roof has sufficient rigidness due to the fixed roof 1 of the <np>
	  vehicle </np> so that the fixture may be removed .
	- The lever 22 is then also in its highest position in which the upper side of the panel 3 is flush
	  with the upper side of the fixed roof 1 of the <np> vehicle </np> .

?	tape drive	US20030142429A1

	- Hence , data is typically transferred through an intermediate staging buffer , such as a hard disk ,
	  to the <np> tape drive </np> , and there is also a desire to release and overwrite the staging
	  buffer as soon as possible .
	- This requires that the <np> tape drive </np> `` backhitch '' after writing the synchronized
	  transaction in order to write the next transaction closely following the preceding transaction .
	- 1 is a block diagram of a magnetic tape drive with a magnetic tape cartridge which <np> tape drive
	  </np> may implement the present invention ;
	- 1 , a <np> tape drive </np> 10 is illustrated which may implement aspects of the present invention .

	  positioned to write data set 32 with a minimum amount of DSS pattern in between ; to backhitch 72
	  after writing data set 32 to synchronize transaction record 51 , and write data set 33 ; etc. .
	- Thus , there is no backhitch , the <np> tape drive </np> continues to write the synchronized

	- If not , the data is written to the magnetic tape 14 employing a normal algorithm in step 205 , for
	  example , writing the data at a time selected by the <np> tape drive </np> , typically to maximize
	  streaming , which may entail delaying the start of writing , in sequence , each data set separated
	  from the previous data set by a DSS .
	- Thus , there is no backhitch , and the <np> tape drive </np> continues to write the transactions
	  without stopping except to reverse directions in the accumulating backhitchless flush wraps , if
	  necessary , along with a seek to a second accumulating backhitchless flush wrap .
	- If the data is `` synchronized '' , the <np> tape drive </np> is required to not return `` Command
	  Complete '' to a write type of command , or an indication-that the command has been or will be
	  successfully executed , until it has actually committed the data to media , specifically , the
	  magnetic tape 14 .

?	nanoparticles	US20070054120A1

	- Over the last decade , <np> nanoparticles </np> , i.e. particles having sizes below 1 micrometer ,
	  have attracted a great deal of interest in research and industry due to their unique properties .
	- B 2000 , 104 , 2824-2828 , `` Liquid phase synthesis doped <np> nanoparticles </np> : colloids of
	  luminescent LaPO4 : Eu and CePO4 : Tb particles with a narrow particle size distribution '' , report
	  for instance quantum yields of less than 10 % for LaPO4 : Eu upon excitation at 277 nm and CePO4 :
	  Tb quantum yields of 16 % , if the emission of cerium is included , and 11 % if the emission of
	  terbium is considered only .
	- For this reason , it may become necessary to subject the <np> nanoparticles </np> to an after-
	  treatment with a suitable polar organic compound , in order to increase their dispersibility .
	- If the <np> nanoparticles </np> have not yet fully precipitated during the reaction or after cooling
	  , it is possible to add methanol to the reaction medium or vice versa in order to obtain maximum
	  yields .
	- According to the claimed process , <np> nanoparticles </np> obtainable according to one of the above
	  synthesis techniques are provided as dispersion in an organic medium -LRB- so-called `` first
	  mixture '' -RRB- .
	- Correspondingly , it is possible and preferred to employ <np> nanoparticles </np> produced in an ``
	  organic '' synthesis or `` polyol or sulfoxide '' in the first step of the claimed process without
	  isolating the same .
	- Thus , due to the ability of the organic medium to coordinate to the metal atom , the <np>
	  nanoparticles </np> are maintained in their colloidal -LRB- non-dissolved -RRB- state before a shell
	  can be grown thereon .
	- Further , it is preferred to wash the <np> nanoparticles </np> obtained , for instance with methanol
	  , ethanol or isopropanol .
	- In order to work up the reaction mixture , firstly diphenylether is distilled off under vacuum at 80
	  ° to 150 ° C. , followed by adding about 200 ml ethanol to the residue in order precipitate the <np>
	  nanoparticles </np> .

	  roof opening -LRB- 2 -RRB- both rearwardly and forwardly under the fixed roof -LRB- 1 -RRB- to open
	  the roof opening -LRB- 2 -RRB- .

	  provided with a roof opening , comprising a longitudinal guide near both longitudinal edges of the
	  roof opening , and a panel being slidably guided in the <np> longitudinal guides </np> such that the
	  panel is adapted to be slid from a closed position in which it closes the roof opening both
	  rearwardly and forwardly with respect to the fixed roof to at least partially open the roof opening
	  .
	- In an embodiment of the sliding roof wherein the panel is made of transparent material , such as
	  glass , and there is also provided a slidable sunshade , it is favorable when the <np> longitudinal
	  guides </np> are attached to a stationary frame and wherein the panel is slidable rearwardly and
	  forwardly between the frame and the fixed roof , and the sunshade is slidable rearwardly between the
	  frame and a roof lining of the vehicle .
	- In this case the vehicle roof , to which the <np> longitudinal guides </np> are attached , lends
	  rigidness to the unit .
	- 4-6 the <np> longitudinal guides </np> are supported by a stationary frame 5 attached under the
	  fixed roof 1 of the vehicle and hidden from view by a roof lining 6 of the vehicle .
	- Between both <np> longitudinal guides </np> there extend not only the panel 3 but also two
	  transverse water gutters 15 and 16 respectively .
	- Both water gutters 15 , 16 are guided with both of their ends slidably in respective <np>
	  longitudinal guides </np> and each of them slides in a different portion of the sliding movement of
	  the panel 3 .
	- The components of the sliding roof remain in this fixture until the <np> longitudinal guides </np>
	  are attached directly to the fixed roof of the vehicle .
