"""

This file can be used to overrule default directories for the stanford tagger
and segmenter and the mallet classifier. For example, to set the stanford tagger
directory uncomment the first line below and set the value to the directory
where the stanford tagger lives on your system.

Note that for mallet the path is to the bin directory inside the mallet
distribution.

Settings in here will be overruled by command line options to keyterms.py.
