    <summary>
      <heading level="2">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en">The present invention relates generally to continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) methods and systems and, more particularly, to a user wearable device such as a pouch or bag which provides a sterile environment for connecting a catheter to a fill-drain tube for feeding and draining dialysis fluid.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en">2. Background Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en">Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is a method for performing dialysis for users with kidney failure. CAPD occurs in the user's peritoneal cavity using dialysis fluid. CAPD functions the same way kidneys do by constantly cleansing the blood as long as there is dialysis fluid in the peritoneal cavity. The dialysis fluid is left in the peritoneal cavity for several hours to collect waste from the blood. The used dialysis fluid is then drained from the peritoneal cavity into a drain bag. Fresh dialysis fluid from a fill bag is then supplied into the peritoneal cavity for the process to start over.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en">In order to exchange used and fresh dialysis fluid in the peritoneal cavity, a catheter tube (catheter) is permanently attached to the user. An interior end of the catheter is surgically inserted through the user's abdomen into the user's peritoneal cavity. An exterior end of the catheter extends out about four inches from the user's abdomen. The user connects the exterior end of the catheter to the fill bag via a fill-drain tube for receiving fresh dialysis fluid into the user's peritoneal cavity. Similarly, the user connects the exterior end of the catheter tube to the drain bag via the fill-drain tube for draining used dialysis fluid from the user's peritoneal cavity. Once the draining and filling operations are completed, the user disconnects the catheter from the fill-drain tube and seals the catheter.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en">The user must repeatedly exchange used and fresh dialysis fluid about four times a day for CAPD. Each exchange encompasses connecting the exterior end of the catheter tube to the fill-drain tube. A problem with each exchange is that the user must make the connections such that no germs or bacteria are introduced into the catheter tube. Germs or bacteria introduced into the catheter can enter the peritoneal cavity and cause infection. Repeated infections scar the peritoneal cavity and cause pain to the user.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en">In order to ensure that no germs or bacteria are introduced into the catheter, the user must perform what is known as the “aseptic technique” for making the connection between the catheter and the fill-drain tube. The aseptic connection technique includes making the connection between the catheter and the fill-drain tube in a closed environment such as a room. All doors, windows, and vents in the room must be closed and all fans in the room turned off in order to keep the air movement in the room at a minimum. The room should also be void of family activity and pets and occur in a spare bedroom or the like. In general, the aseptic connection technique requires appropriate environmental conditions which limit the mobility and flexibility of the user and require limitations on space resources.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en">What is needed is a portable device which effectively consolidates the size of a typical closed environment such as a spare bedroom into a much smaller size. Such a portable device would provide a sterile environment for connecting the catheter to the fill-drain tube for an exchange of used and fresh dialysis fluid even when the user is located in an environment unsuitable for the aseptic connection technique. As a result, a user wearing such a portable device while situated within a hostile environment, such as room where the windows are open or on a boat in a lake, could connect the dialysis tubes in order to perform an exchange in a sterile environment thereby satisfying the aseptic connection technique.</p>
      <heading level="2">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00010-en">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a user wearable portable device such as a pouch or bag which provides a sterile environment for connecting the user's catheter to a fill-drain tube for performing an exchange of used and fresh dialysis fluid.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en">It is another object of the present invention to provide a user wearable pouch which provides a sterile environment for connecting the user's catheter to a fill-drain tube for performing an exchange of used and fresh dialysis fluid.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a user wearable pouch having openings for inserting the user's catheter and a fill-drain tube into the interior of the pouch such that the user can connect the catheter to the fill-drain tube within the interior of the pouch for draining and feeding dialysis fluid in a sterile environment.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en">It is still another object of the present invention to provide a user wearable pouch having covered openings for inserting the user's catheter and a fill-drain tube into the interior of the pouch and having internally disposed hand covering elements in communication with the exterior of the pouch such that the user can insert his hands into the hand covering elements and connect the catheter to the fill-drain tube within the interior of the pouch for performing an exchange of used and fresh dialysis fluid in a sterile environment.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en">It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a user wearable pouch having covered openings for inserting a user's catheter and a fill-drain tube into respective sleeves extending into the interior of the pouch such that the user can expose the catheter and the fill-drain tube from the respective sleeves within the interior of the pouch and connect the catheter to the fill-drain tube within the interior of the pouch for performing an exchange of used and fresh dialysis fluid in a sterile environment.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en">It is still yet another object of the present invention to provide a user wearable pouch having a sterile interior operable for receiving a catheter and a fill-drain tube from sources exterior to the pouch such that the user can connect the catheter and the fill-drain tube in a sterile environment.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en">It is still yet a further object of the present invention to provide a user wearable pouch having internally disposed hand covering elements for enabling the user to insert his hands into the hand covering elements and connect the user's catheter to a fill-drain tube in the sterile interior of the pouch while manipulating the catheter and the fill-drain tube from a non-sterile environment external to the pouch.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en">Yet, it is still another object of the present invention to provide a peritoneal dialysis system having a user wearable pouch which provides a sterile environment for connecting the user's catheter to a fill-drain tube connected to a fill bag and a drain bag for performing an exchange of used and fresh dialysis fluid.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en">Yet, it is a further object of the present invention for providing a method for performing an exchange of used and fresh dialysis fluid by connecting a user's catheter to a fill-drain tube within the interior of a user wearable portable device.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en">In carrying out the above objects and other objects, the present invention provides a user wearable device for connecting a catheter of the user to a fill-drain tube for performing an exchange of dialysis fluid. The device includes a pouch having an interior formed by connected front and back sides. The front side of the pouch has an exposeable opening for inserting a fill-drain tube into the interior of the pouch.

A catheter clamp may be connected to one of the front and back sides of the pouch within the interior of the pouch.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en">Further, in carrying out the above objects and other objects, the present invention provides a user wearable device for connecting an external end of a catheter connected to a user to a first end of a fill-drain tube connected at a second end to a fill bag and a drain bag for performing an exchange of dialysis fluid. The device includes a pouch having a closed interior, a first exposeable opening for inserting a first end of a fill-drain tube from an exterior of the pouch into the interior of the pouch, and a second exposeable opening for inserting an external end of a catheter of a user from the exterior of the pouch into the interior of the pouch. The device further includes a pair of hand covering elements in communication with the exterior of the pouch and internally disposed into the interior of the pouch for receiving the hands of the user in order to enable the user to connect the external end of the catheter to the first end of the fill-drain tube within the interior of the pouch for performing an exchange of dialysis fluid.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en">Also, in carrying out the above objects and other objects, the present invention provides a peritoneal dialysis system for a user having a catheter. The system includes a fill bag for feeding dialysis fluid, a drain bag for draining dialysis fluid, and a fill-drain tube connected at a first end by a Y connection to the fill bag and the drain bag. The system further includes a user wearable device having a closed pouch. The pouch has a first exposeable opening for inserting a second end of the fill-drain tube into the pouch and a second exposeable opening for inserting a catheter of a user wearing the pouch into the pouch in order to enable the catheter and the second end of the fill-drain tube to be connected together within the pouch by manipulation from outside of the pouch.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en">Still further, in carrying out the above objects and other objects, the present invention provides a method for performing an exchange of used and fresh dialysis fluid on a user having a catheter. The method includes providing a closed pouch having a first exposeable opening and a second exposeable opening. A catheter of the user is then inserted into pouch through the first exposeable opening. A fill-drain tube is then inserted into the pouch through the second exposeable opening. The catheter and the fill-drain tube are then connected together in the pouch by manipulation of the catheter and the fill-drain tube from outside of the pouch.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en">The method may further include attaching the pouch to the user after the catheter is inserted into the pouch through the first exposeable opening. The pouch may be attached to the user by using an adhesive positioned around the first exposeable opening on the outside of the pouch and then attaching the adhesive to the user around the catheter.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en">The method may also include connecting the catheter to the fill-drain tube by using a pair of hand covering elements in communication with the exterior of the pouch and internally disposed into the interior of the pouch for receiving the hands of the user.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en">The pouch may further include a catheter clamp in the pouch. The method may further include clamping the catheter with the catheter clamp prior to connecting the catheter to the fill-drain tube and removing the catheter clamp from the catheter after connecting the catheter to the fill-drain tube.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en">The advantages accruing to the present invention are numerous. For instance, the present invention provides a disposable and portable accessory that reduces the risk of peritonitis due to environmental contaminants carried in the air; increases the flexibility of scheduling exchanges outside of the traditional aspectic environment such as a spare bedroom thereby increasing the user's mobility; provides a safe, pathogenic-free environment for dialysis fluid exchanges; and increases the desirability of peritoneal dialysis as a method of treating renal disease.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en">In essence, the present invention provides for the flexibility of doing a safe dialysis fluid exchange at any time in any environment setting. For example, users of the present invention do not need to worry about the surrounding environmental conditions for performing a safe dialysis fluid exchange (i.e., closed room with no other people in the room, ventilation system off, window closed, clean surface to lay supplies on, and antibacterial hand washing). This enables users to not want to skip treatment because of an event keeping the user away from a set location for performing a dialysis exchange or in the case where the surrounding environmental conditions are adverse. The present invention further reduces the need for setting aside a location such as a room dedicated to having the appropriate environmental conditions.</p>

      <heading level="2">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</heading>
      <p id="p-00042-en">Referring now to<figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) user<b>10</b>having a catheter tube (catheter)<b>12</b>is shown. Catheter<b>12</b>is permanently attached to the abdomen<b>14</b>of user<b>10</b>. An internal end<b>16</b>of catheter<b>12</b>is surgically inserted through abdomen<b>14</b>of user<b>10</b>into the user's peritoneal cavity<b>18</b>. An external end<b>20</b>of catheter<b>12</b>extends externally out from abdomen<b>14</b>of user<b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en">User<b>10</b>uses catheter<b>12</b>to exchange used dialysis fluid in peritoneal cavity<b>18</b>for fresh dialysis fluid. User<b>10</b>connects external end<b>20</b>of catheter<b>12</b>to a first end<b>23</b>of a fill-drain tube<b>22</b>. A Y connector<b>24</b>connects a second end<b>25</b>of fill-drain tube<b>22</b>to a fill bag<b>26</b>and a drain bag<b>28</b>. Fill bag<b>26</b>contains fresh dialysis fluid for insertion into peritoneal cavity<b>18</b>of user<b>10</b>. Drain bag<b>28</b>is used to contain used dialysis fluid drained from peritoneal cavity<b>18</b>of user<b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en">In order to perform CAPD, user<b>10</b>connects external end<b>20</b>of catheter<b>12</b>to drain bag<b>28</b>via fill-drain tube<b>22</b>for draining used dialysis fluid from user's peritoneal cavity<b>18</b>. The used dialysis fluid drains from user's peritoneal cavity<b>18</b>into drain bag<b>28</b>in the direction of the arrow pointing to the drain bag shown in FIG.<b>2</b>. Once the used dialysis fluid is drained from user's peritoneal cavity<b>18</b>, user<b>10</b>connects external end<b>20</b>of catheter<b>12</b>to fill bag<b>26</b>via fill-drain tube<b>22</b>for receiving fresh dialysis fluid into the user's peritoneal cavity. The fresh dialysis fluid fills from fill bag<b>26</b>into user's peritoneal cavity<b>18</b>in the direction of the arrow pointing away from the fill bag shown in FIG.<b>2</b>. Once the draining and filling operations are completed, user<b>10</b>disconnects external end<b>20</b>of catheter<b>12</b>from fill-drain tube<b>22</b>and seals the external end of the catheter. The fresh dialysis fluid is then left in user's peritoneal cavity<b>18</b>to clean the user's body and the process starts over once the fresh dialysis fluid becomes used.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en">As described above, user<b>10</b>is required to use the aseptic technique for making the connection between external end<b>20</b>of catheter<b>12</b>and first end<b>23</b>of fill-drain tube<b>22</b>, i.e., connecting the catheter to the fill-drain tube. This means that catheter<b>12</b>and fill-drain tube<b>22</b>must be connected together in a sterile environment.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en">Referring now to<figref>FIGS. 3</figref>,<b>4</b>,<b>5</b>,<b>6</b>, and<b>7</b>, with continual reference to<figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a user wearable device<b>30</b>which provides a sterile environment for connecting catheter<b>12</b>to fill-drain tube<b>22</b>is shown. In general, device<b>30</b>is a closed pouch or bag made of plastic or the like. Preferably, the plastic is the type of plastic typically used for medical and sterile applications. Of course, other types of material instead of plastic may be used for making pouch<b>30</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en">Pouch<b>30</b>includes a front side<b>32</b>and a back side<b>34</b>connected together around their edges to form an interior<b>36</b>within the internal sides of the front and back sides. Front side<b>32</b>and back side<b>34</b>isolate interior<b>36</b>from environmental conditions external to pouch<b>30</b>such as contaminants carried by air flow, moisture, etc. As a result of being shielded from external environmental conditions, interior<b>36</b>provides a closed, sterile environment. In use, user<b>10</b>connects catheter<b>12</b>to fill-drain tube<b>22</b>in the closed, sterile environment provided by interior<b>36</b>thereby satisfying the aseptic connection technique for the exchange of used and fresh dialysis fluid as described with reference to FIG.<b>2</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en">Pouch<b>30</b>is intended to be worn around user's abdomen<b>14</b>as shown in<figref>FIG. 7</figref>with front side<b>32</b>facing away from the user's abdomen and back side<b>34</b>facing towards the user's abdomen for performing an exchange of dialysis fluid. Front side<b>32</b>of pouch<b>30</b>includes a first exposeable opening<b>38</b>. A first peel away covering element<b>40</b>such as a peel away seal covers first exposeable opening<b>38</b>. User<b>10</b>peels first covering element<b>40</b>to expose first opening<b>38</b>. User<b>10</b>then inserts first end<b>23</b>of fill-drain tube<b>22</b>through first opening<b>38</b>into interior<b>36</b>of pouch<b>30</b>. Back side<b>34</b>of pouch<b>30</b>includes a second exposeable opening<b>42</b>. A second peel away covering element<b>44</b>such as a peel away seal covers second exposeable opening<b>42</b>. User<b>10</b>peels second covering element<b>44</b>to expose second opening<b>42</b>. User<b>10</b>then inserts external end<b>20</b>of catheter<b>12</b>through second opening<b>42</b>into interior<b>36</b>of pouch<b>30</b>. From the exterior of pouch<b>30</b>, user<b>10</b>then clamps and manipulates catheter<b>12</b>and fill-drain tube<b>22</b>within interior<b>36</b>of the pouch to connect external end<b>20</b>of the catheter to first end<b>23</b>of the fill-drain tube.<figref>FIG. 3</figref>best illustrates the connection between external end<b>20</b>of catheter<b>12</b>and first end<b>23</b>of fill-drain tube<b>22</b>within interior<b>36</b>of pouch<b>30</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en">In order to enable user<b>10</b>to manipulate catheter<b>12</b>and fill-drain tube<b>22</b>from the exterior of pouch<b>30</b>, the pouch further includes a pair of hand covering elements<b>46</b>. Hand covering elements<b>46</b>such as mittens, gloves, or the like are formed between front side<b>32</b>and back side<b>34</b>of pouch<b>30</b>. Hand covering elements<b>46</b>are in communication with the exterior of pouch<b>30</b>and are internally disposed into interior<b>36</b>of the pouch for receiving the hands<b>48</b>of user<b>10</b>(shown best in FIG.<b>7</b>). User<b>10</b>inserts his hands<b>48</b>into hand covering elements<b>46</b>in order to manipulate catheter<b>12</b>and fill-drain tube<b>22</b>contained within interior<b>36</b>of pouch<b>30</b>from the outside of the pouch in order to connect them together.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en">Pouch<b>30</b>also includes a fill-drain tube sleeve<b>50</b>connected to first exposeable opening<b>38</b>of front side<b>32</b>. Fill-drain tube sleeve<b>50</b>extends from first exposeable opening<b>38</b>into interior<b>36</b>of pouch<b>30</b>. Fill-drain tube sleeve<b>50</b>receives fill-drain tube<b>22</b>when the fill-drain tube is inserted through first exposeable opening<b>38</b>. Similarly, pouch<b>30</b>further includes a catheter sleeve<b>52</b>connected to second exposeable opening<b>42</b>of back side<b>34</b>. Catheter sleeve<b>52</b>extends from second exposeable opening<b>42</b>into interior<b>36</b>of pouch<b>30</b>. Catheter sleeve<b>52</b>receives catheter<b>12</b>when the catheter is inserted through second exposeable opening<b>42</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en">Fill-drain tube sleeve<b>50</b>and catheter sleeve<b>52</b>extend from respective openings<b>38</b>and<b>42</b>towards one another within the middle portion of interior<b>36</b>of pouch<b>30</b>. Fill-drain tube sleeve<b>50</b>and catheter sleeve<b>52</b>direct inserted fill-drain tube<b>22</b>and catheter<b>12</b>towards one another within the middle portion of interior<b>36</b>of pouch<b>30</b>. Fill-drain tube sleeve<b>50</b>and catheter sleeve<b>52</b>are each sealed at their ends away from openings<b>38</b>and<b>42</b>by respective tear away elements<b>54</b>. Tear away elements<b>54</b>are each connected by a perforation line<b>56</b>to the ends of fill-drain tube sleeve<b>50</b>and catheter sleeve<b>52</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en">User<b>10</b>tears away each tear away element<b>54</b>along its perforation line<b>56</b>to expose the ends of tubes (fill-drain and catheter) from their respective sleeves<b>50</b>and<b>52</b>within the middle portion of interior<b>36</b>of pouch<b>30</b>. For instance, as shown in<figref>FIG. 8</figref>, tear away element<b>54</b>is torn along its perforation line<b>56</b>from catheter sleeve<b>52</b>to expose external end<b>20</b>of catheter<b>12</b>. Similarly, tear away element<b>54</b>is torn along its perforation line<b>56</b>from fill-drain tube sleeve<b>50</b>to expose first end<b>23</b>of fill-drain tube<b>22</b>. User<b>10</b>then uses hand covering elements<b>46</b>to manipulate from outside of pouch<b>30</b>the exposed first end<b>23</b>of fill-drain tube<b>22</b>and the exposed external end<b>20</b>of catheter<b>12</b>contained within interior<b>36</b>of pouch<b>30</b>to connect them together within the interior of the pouch. Instead of being provided with perforation lines<b>56</b>, each element<b>54</b>may be configured to fold up and over the exterior surface of the ends of sleeves<b>50</b>and<b>52</b>and then be sealed down with a seal onto the exterior surfaces of the sleeve ends.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en">Pouch<b>30</b>further includes a clamping device<b>58</b>for clamping external end<b>20</b>of catheter<b>12</b>during an exchange of used and fresh dialysis fluid. Clamping device<b>58</b>is contained within interior<b>36</b>of pouch<b>30</b>and is connected to one of the interior sides of front side<b>32</b>and back side<b>34</b>. As best shown in<figref>FIG. 9</figref>, user<b>10</b>uses clamping device<b>58</b>to clamp catheter<b>12</b>as is typically done for performing CAPD. As is the case for the connection between catheter<b>12</b>and fill-drain tube<b>22</b>, user<b>10</b>uses hand covering elements<b>46</b>to manipulate clamping device<b>58</b>from the outside of pouch<b>30</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en">In operation for performing a standard peritoneal dialysis exchange, user<b>10</b>clamps catheter<b>12</b>with clamping device<b>58</b>before the catheter is connected to fill-drain tube<b>22</b>to close the catheter. User<b>10</b>then opens fill bag<b>26</b>to allow some fresh dialysis fluid to fill from the fill bag into drain bag<b>28</b>. User<b>10</b>then clamps off fill bag<b>26</b>with a fill bag clamping device to stop fresh dialysis fluid from feeding from the fill bag. User<b>10</b>then removes clamping device<b>48</b>to open the catheter in order to allow used dialysis fluid from peritoneal cavity<b>18</b>to drain into drain bag<b>28</b>. Once the used dialysis fluid is drained, user<b>10</b>clamps off drain bag with a drain bag clamping device to prevent fluid from flowing into the drain bag and then removes the fill bag clamping device from fill bag<b>26</b>to allow fresh dialysis fluid to flow from the fill bag into the user's peritoneal cavity<b>18</b>via catheter<b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en">Prior to use, interior<b>36</b>of pouch<b>30</b>provides a closed, sterile environment as first and second openings<b>38</b>and<b>42</b>are covered or sealed by respective covering elements<b>40</b>and<b>44</b>and the ends of sleeves<b>50</b>and<b>52</b>are sealed by respective tear away elements<b>54</b>. During use, the closed, sterile environment provided by interior<b>36</b>of pouch<b>30</b>is left intact as only openings<b>38</b>and<b>42</b>are exposed to allow insertion of fill-drain tube<b>22</b>and catheter<b>12</b>into respective sleeves<b>50</b>and<b>52</b>. Once inserted through openings<b>38</b>and<b>42</b>, fill-drain tube<b>22</b>and catheter<b>12</b>effectively act as covering elements<b>40</b>and<b>44</b>and shield interior<b>36</b>of pouch<b>30</b>from external environmental conditions. After fill-drain tube<b>22</b>and catheter<b>12</b>are inserted into their respective sleeves<b>50</b>and<b>52</b>into interior<b>36</b>of pouch<b>30</b>, then tear away elements<b>54</b>are torn away from the sleeves to expose the ends of fill-drain tube and catheter within the interior of the pouch. Thus, during the entire usage of pouch<b>30</b>, interior<b>36</b>of pouch<b>30</b>provides a closed, sterile environment for effecting a connection between catheter<b>12</b>and fill-drain tube<b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en">As shown best in<figref>FIG. 7</figref>, pouch<b>30</b>is intended to be worn by user<b>10</b>. To this end, pouch<b>30</b>includes a pair of apron strings<b>60</b>or the like. Apron strings<b>60</b>are connected on opposing ends of pouch<b>30</b>to at least one of front side<b>32</b>and back side<b>34</b>and preferably connected to back side<b>34</b>. Apron strings<b>60</b>are tied around user's abdomen<b>14</b>in order for the user to wear pouch<b>30</b>. Back side<b>34</b>of pouch<b>30</b>may also include a breathable, mesh type fabric or plastic to provide a comfortable fit of the pouch with user's abdomen<b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en">Pouch<b>30</b>is configured such that second opening<b>42</b>is aligned with the exit point of catheter<b>12</b>from user's abdomen<b>14</b>when the pouch is worn by user<b>10</b>. This provides a comfortable and snug fit with user<b>10</b>and also uses the user's body to effectively seal second opening<b>42</b>when exposed. To this end, a medical type adhesive pad<b>62</b>is positioned around second opening<b>42</b>on back side<b>34</b>of pouch<b>30</b>. Second covering element<b>44</b>covers adhesive pad<b>62</b>until the second covering element is peeled away.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en">In order to assist use of pouch<b>30</b>, the elements of the pouch may be colored differently. For instance, front and back sides<b>32</b>and<b>34</b>may have a transparent color whereas elements contained within interior of pouch<b>30</b>such as sleeves<b>50</b>and<b>52</b>may be colored (same or different colors) to assist user<b>10</b>in recognizing the sleeves.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en">Further, in helping prevent infection of the exit point of catheter<b>12</b>on user's abdomen<b>14</b>, a catheter safety cap<b>80</b>in accordance with the present invention may be provided. Safety cap<b>80</b>snaps on and off a ring attached to the user's abdomen<b>14</b>. The ring includes a medical type adhesive for attaching around the exit point of catheter<b>12</b>on user's abdomen<b>14</b>. User<b>10</b>snaps safety cap<b>80</b>on the ring to cover catheter<b>12</b>and the exit point of the catheter upon completion of an exchange of used and fresh dialysis fluid. In use, safety cap<b>80</b>prevents germs from traveling along catheter<b>12</b>through the exit point into user's peritoneal cavity.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en">In essence, the user wearable device or pouch<b>30</b>functions as a sterile, pathogenic-free environment for containing catheter<b>12</b>protruding from the user's abdomen<b>14</b>, fill-drain tube<b>22</b>, and any clamping devices<b>58</b>necessary during the hook-up phase of a peritoneal dialysis fluid exchange. Pouch<b>30</b>allows user<b>10</b>to manipulate the elements<b>12</b>,<b>22</b>,<b>58</b>, etc., contained within interior<b>36</b>of the pouch from outside of the pouch in order to complete the peritoneal dialysis connections in any environmental setting.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en">Thus it is apparent that there has been provided, in accordance with the present invention, a user wearable device such as a pouch which provides a sterile environment for connecting a catheter to a fill-drain tube for feeding and draining dialysis fluid that fully satisfies the objects, aims, and advantages set forth above. While the present invention has been described in conjunction with specific embodiments thereof, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing description. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications, and variations as fall within the spirit and broad scope of the appended claims.</p>
